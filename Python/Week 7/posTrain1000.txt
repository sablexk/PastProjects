Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.
This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style, with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won't have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it's warm without being bulky. and to top it off, it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least.
I needed a dress that was easy to throw on for summer days and this dress is perfect for that. it's flattering, light weight and unique. i've received a handful of compliments while wearing this dress. i am 5' 6" 150 lbs, hourglass figure and typically purchase a small or medium (8-10) and chose a small for this dress. i'd say it's still loose on me- which is what i prefer. the scoop neck and cut out allows you wear a normal bra. however, i've noticed i'm more comfortable wearing a camisole or s
I love paige brand pants-they are soft, comfortable, and forgiving. i love these, and want them badly. the are still tight all the way to the knee and then go out into a flattering flare-it is difficult to find the perfect fit on something like this-and paige has done a wonderful job for my body.  my store does not carry petite so i tried these on in regular length. they were significantly too long for me (5'3") probably 3-4 inches to long. i am hoping for a sale so i can buy them in petite for
This top is really pretty and nice quality. runs big - i went down a size, and its perfect. coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo.
I tried on the petite size in my usual xs, adn i actually have to go down to xxs, i looked overtaken by the shirt. i'm 5'2" and 115lbs)  cut is flowy and not close to the body, sleeves are narrower, but still ok with athletic built.  color: light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair, but for my pale self, the darker one was better... but can't go wrong, i ordered both colors and liked both of them.  ruffle is a great addition too...
I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino. great for hot days of summer. the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg. overall a really flattering cut. the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top.
These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a
I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller. it runs very generous, and so the sizing is a little off. the style and quality are beautiful, so i am anxious to receive the smaller size.
The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.  very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!
I got a small mauve. the fit is great and the length is perfect for me, just few inches above my knees. cute and cozy! what more can i aske for!?
Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected, but that's the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up, it might be a little longer in the body, but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn't too thick, so it's a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!
I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews, but i should have ordered my own size, as they're a bit loose around the waist. the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering, so i definitely recommend them!
This is exactly what i was expecting. cute, comfortable and casual. there are some gold sequins in the scroll work that i didn't see online. they are super pretty in person.
I love these pants. i have worn them a number of times already this season. i am 5' so i did have to have them hemmed. i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still 3 or 4 on the pants so i don't think they look odd. i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps. a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks!
I love this tunic the natural color is just that, this is a tunic so the fit is a little large. i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top
These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.
I have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite. great comfy, casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up. highly recommend for summer!
Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.
I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly, it fits me very well (i'm 5'2", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much, and it's not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it's brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way, the fabric is super soft (but not w
From the picture i wasn't sure how it would fit. got in the mail and i love it. fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it. definitely should of gotten a large.
I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price, and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat. the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily. other than that, the silhouette of the coat is perfect...not too boxy! it's also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter. i love it!
This top is very cute. got it in the lighter color. the fit is great and it will go with many things. if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also.
This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!
I ordered this dress in both colors. the peach color is so beautiful in person. i'm planning to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner at the end of the summer, if i can hold off until then! definitely worth the price.
This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color, it's gorgeous in person, very bright, vibrant colors. i am 5'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out, and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads, if you're thinking about buying this dress, do it, you won't regret it!
Absolutely love this dress! fits true to size and makes anyone look fabulous
Per other reviewers, i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers. it is short (cropped), but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses.
I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...  i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on
Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.  a must have for the summer!!!!!!
Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details. soft and not baggy. a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier. i'm 5'7", 140 pounds with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd. i bought the "2" which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt (i'm normally an retailer small but i don't think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted). great comfy weekend piece!
I could wear this every day, it is stylish and comfortable
Pretty top. love the color and the large ruffle. makes it great for layering or with a pretty necklace.
Love this top! it is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly. i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments. love both colors, and having fun wearing them. and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic. runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect. if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size
Love, love, love this dress. it is very slimming. it hugs you without really touching you. leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel.
I'm 5'3 130# with a 32dd bust. i usually wear small in retailer/ cloth and stone/ running horses. the small fit me fine, but with no room for layers underneath. the small was very snug. would be perfect for california evenings. but, i live in the north east! the medium still has a great shape on me, still fitted at the waist (27inches), but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under. the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress.
This dress is gorgeous!!! i love it! i bought it to wear to a july wedding. i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color. the sizing is on spot! i slipped it on and it was comfortable, easy and stylish. i am 5'7" and typically xs. it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos. it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight! i am in love!
This shirt is one of my favorite retailer purchases ever! it is well made and is perfect for work or the weekend. the first time i wore it, i received so many compliments!
I want to live in this sweatshirt. it's so comfy, but also well-cut and lays nicely, not boxy at all. i'm typically a 10-12 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy.
After missing out on last year's similar dress, i am so glad i finally purchased this one! it is beautiful in person. i bought to wear to a wedding, but i am curious if others think it might be too white? i bought the peach color. i will keep this dress no matter what. hope they come out with more next season!
I read the reviews and because this jacket is pilcro i took a chance. i was thrilled when i rceived this jacket. darker color of denim with weathered edges. i absolutely love it. don't let it get away. great jean jackets are hard to come by.
Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i didn't give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i'd love it even more if it wasn't distressed at all, then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it's my favorite, great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors!
The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring.
Love it; the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim.
I love these. i'm between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s. they fit well. as expected. very nice fabric. good design. have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in. fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice.
I lost my favorite denim jacket on a trip a few years ago and haven't found one i really liked again...until now. great quality - just heavy enough but not too heavy, just stretchy enough but not too stretchy, great color/design. no complaints. i read the other reviews and was happy to have ordered one size larger than my normal. i typically take a small but the medium in this is perfect. it is possible i actually like this jacket better than the one i lost several years ago, which is a big endo
Beautiful colors and silhouette (i got the navy). the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk. i've gotten a ton of compliments on it. i'm 5'9" and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee, and the low hem falls to my ankles.
I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring / summer. the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tucked-in. the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color.
I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.
I'm 5'4" 125 lbs ordered small. fits perfect. super soft denim. love the color love the worn in feel
I have been searching for the perfect denim jacket and this it! i love the darker color, more modern day less 80s. it runs a little small. i am always either a s or xs at retailer. lately, their clothes seem to be running a little bigger, so i have been an xs in most tops. when i order online, i never know which size to get. i ordered an xs, however it was very tight in the arms and across the shoulders. i wanted to be able to roll the sleeves up, so i returned it for a s and it fits great. i was
I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite
I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was! it is an absolute must-have!
I love this little jean jacket! i am petite and usually get a xxsp , but went for a size up. i'm glad i did. it fits a little snug. the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim. the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me. i love this - over maxi dresses, tanks, etc... adorable jacket - great buy!!
This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale, but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online, i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i'm small-chested so both the s and m fit, but the seam on the s fit a bit higher, which was more flattering on me, so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down
I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don't live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs, 5'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on, they just don't look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a
I purchased the navy color of this dress. not only did it look good, but felt good as well. since it is for a wedding, i also purchased a white crochet cropped "sweater" to wear over as well, making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom. could not have been happier.
This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight, but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep, but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work.
Love this top! made with 100% cotton, a vintage look, and flattering details this top is a winner for me. i think it fits true to size (got my regular size 0) and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short (5'3"). it is somewhat see through, but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work, i think it can be worn without a cami. the perfect lightweight, comfortable, standout piece for the summer time :)
I really like this blouse a lot. very very easy to wear!! i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend. very flattering and great blue color!!! very happy with this purchase. highly recommend. i am 5'6" short torso and my usual 6 worked.
I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri
Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn't know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven't worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i'm usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it's a great buy especially since it's on sale now.
This is an awesome vest - so soft, cozy, and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did, i'll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though.
I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes, polka dots and sweet flowers.
This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin, light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket.
This is a beautiful blouse...sheer and feminine. i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual. it is a full top...can't tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms. so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size. this is supposed to be a full, shorter fit...i would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b
The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5'5"there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots, flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined, but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets.
I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p
I absolutely love this sweater!! it's soft, easy to wash, and looks great!
The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish.
I love this tee! the material is thick but not too thick. it's highly flattering- i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings. the shimmer on the front adds something special.
I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts.   my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.
My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter.
This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter. it's versatile- i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs! there's so many options i cannot wait to put this gorgeous piece to use! just as an fyi, the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them. this may not even be noticeable if you're not looking right up close. for me, this adds to the unique quality
I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person! the description didn't give as much information as i wanted so i'm going to be very detailed in this review. i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose (two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time), and i'll have to hand sew others on more tightly. my usual size is a pxs or p0, and there were no petite sizes available. however the size 0 fits perfectly, no alterations need
When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.
Wasn't sure about this top based on reviews, but glad i purchased! pretty print, looks great with denim. very loose, flowy top. hangs a little short, but that's the style of this blouse. fit true to size. i usually wear a 2/4 and xs/sm with 30dd. size small worked for me.
This too is so beautiful in person. there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming. i love this top with business attire and denim. fits tts.
I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft, good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i'm sure i would get a lot of use out of this top, but ultimately it didn't thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still, a very nice top. i may buy it eventually, especially if it goes on sale.
I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush.
I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely. i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office. the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out. really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal!
I am 5.6", 138 pounds. i purchased this in a size small. it is flowy and not too short. it has a comfortable, but still feminine and beautiful fit. one of my favorite new blouses...the red print is gorgeous
I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely, though - pretty and funky at the same time. it's sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer.
I saw this in-store, tried it on, and was sold. it is not just super soft but very flattering on. i am petite, 105 lbs and bought the xs in black- the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed. i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans.
Love this. it's heavy/warm, stylish and a great throw on any outfit. oversized style.
Tts. i'm wearing a small. the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants. washed nicely. layers flat to dry. had to iron the shell underneath. great for casual office.
I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it's pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it, and find it's flattering for my curvy figure.
I love the sweatshirt   clay color is very different it's a nice light fabric with nice detailed edges   although it is an oversized piece it hangs and fits well although i am petite  great light sweatshirt for spring and summer
Love the patterns and the length.  i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets.  it's really a special piece and on sale, very worth it!
I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it. i am either an xs or s in antho, and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy. normally i would have overlooked this shirt as it's rather unimpressive on the hanger, but it was on sale so i tried it on. very cute when tried on! it fits well across the shoulders but isn't too clingy in the body, which i like. the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor
Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i don't think it's too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5'8" and athletic.
All the rave reviews are true!  this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it. i'm having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this. this is a great three season layering piece and i'm thrilled i was able to get it on sale.  my only regret was the lack of a petite selection.
I love this top. i got it on sale and am so glad that i did. it is a short too but still super flattering. it isn't too boxy on me.
I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it's wool i didn't notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent
This has great drape, length, the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints. i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck, so not sure if i will keep, though i don't seem to want to take it off! has a lightweight, boiled wool texture, contrasting print and design so cool!
I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person, and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile, and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly, the pattern is cleverly designed which doesn't compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i'm 5'2", 34b, 26 waist, and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the
Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not
An excellent going out to dinner, to a lounge, etc. piece. super flattering, sexy, feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i'm only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits, but this was excellent!
I would've looked right over this online but i saw it in store and had to try on. the navy and the white were both cute but i tried the navy. i'm usually a m but went with the s b/c it looked better fitted. this shirt has a very vintage feel to it and is slinky and comfy. i can't wait to wear. would look great with white jeans!
This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it. it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness . i like everything about it!
I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater.
This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it - love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful. the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight, so definitely appropriate for winter, fall, and cooler spring days. i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot - it was wider down the torso and a little shorter (not tunic length like picture). i'm 5'7" with a longer torso and this hit maybe mid-bum and
I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however, after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing, so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person, and very soft and warm. it's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5'-7", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly, though it's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos.
Great fit! no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size. very cute! for reference, i&#39;m 5&#39;2, 115 lbs and take a 26p. they look just like they do on the model. i highly recommend!
The length is perfect. the cut of the hemline makes it off the charts cute. i love it w ghillie type flats or booties. pair w a big warm sweater, or a sleek turtleneck, and watch heads turn as you enter the room! i promise! love this skirt.
This dress is beautifully constructed. it is very fitted and does run on the small side. it will be a perfect derby dress. the lace is lovely and the pearl buttons are great touch. age appropriate for anyone..a very  pretty dress. simple, classic and gorgeous!
The color is a very soft peach, and the knit top over the gauze is a very light, summer-weight knit. i can see this being worn casual, or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt / pants.
I bought the dress that has the cream skirt with large flowers. i wore it for a wedding and was not only very comfortable with the pockets and the cotton top, i looked good. i got a lot of compliments on the outfit. people thought it was a shirt and blouse rather than a dress. i loved the high low skirt. the sizing was accurate and the dress is easy to clean.
Soft, comfortable, stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile.
Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my man-back appearance. cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem. not clingy, very soft fabric doesn't accentuate bulges so i am happy about it's forgiving silhouette.
I walked into retailer with low hopes of finding a dress for a friend's spring wedding, as a lot of this season's dresses are more casual, but was drawn to this pretty number for multiple reasons: it can certainly be dressed up or down depending upon accessories, the fabric feels incredible, it has pockets, and it's really fun yet classy as heck. typically i wear a 10/m in dresses, but they only had a 12 in store, so i took it and made it work by tightening the sash a bit extra and wearing a bra w
I was able to snatch this dress up just before it sold out (and i see it's now back in stock!). the quality of the fabrics is outstanding, not flimsy at all. the top is stretchy. normally i would wear a 2 at retailer, but the only choice i had was 0 and it fit. i am 5'5" tall, 125 lbs. everything about this dress makes me smile and i can't wait to wear it to my holiday party! don't hesitate if you are on the fence.
I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on! it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful! the bodice fits really nicely. true to size. there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird. love love love!!! wearing for christmas eve!
I got he green color with gray accent stitching, looks awesome with gray tone leggings. super soft, definitely runs a little big (5'6" 140 lbs i ordered the small) but not in an unflattering way.
Love this tunic, it's super comfy & cute. i have in cream and love so much i ordered in mint. looks great with jeans and boots
I really love this lace-up shirt, but i only liked it in black on me. i like it open like the model is wearing it, but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a ways-and i felt like i was revealing a little too much. i would likely wear it open, but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable. i absolutely love the whole outfit as-pictured, and also reviewed the polka dot pants. i wish the laces were a little longer than they are-if you have i
Love this blouse, it;s super comfy, looks awesome with jeans. this blouse runs true to size i purchased in my normal size small.
I was hesitant based on the reviews, but i'm glad i ordered this dress (in blue). the material is like a french dot texture that is soft but still a bit structured. i had no issues with the fit. it's appropriately just a little oversized. the styling is very mod!
I purchased this jacket in green, x-small a while back and wasn?t 100% sure about it due to the size. i?m 5?3?, 117 lbs and a 33a and thought it was a little snug so i tried on the small and that was way too big so i kept the xs. i have worn it a few times and it does look great however i can only wear thin tops with it. recently i purchased the black, x-small and this i love. it?s looser then the green so i can get away with thicker tops.  i do recommend both jackets. they are pricey for what
I love this jacket over a dress! it's snug fitting so can't wear anything bulky under it, but super stylish and comfy stretchy material. it's a bit pricey but i get a lot of wear out of it so worth it to me.
I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs.  i ordered this in a xsp and i could barely zip it up.  and when i did i couldn't breathe. i tried again and ordered a sp and it's perfect! now i just need somewhere to wear it.
Beautiful shirt, hits me a little higher. i'm not sure i'm going to keep it just because i have something similar but its a beautiful top. i'm 5'6" and carrying a little extra baby weight right now so i'm an 8-10 instead of my usual 6-8. i ordered an 8 and it fit well.
I love this blouse because it's great for work with cardigan over it, and great for going out with skirt, pants or jeans. it is tts and very flattering, light weight, and comfortable.
I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted, left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it doesn't need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o
Great looking jacket with attitude. the color is more like a faded black or deep charcoal grey. i'm usually a large petite but this is snug in the chest. luckily it's a knit so i can make it work by zipping it partway and leaving the top half open.
These jeans are so cute! they are perfect for petites too! i am fit, look way younger than my age and get so many compliments when i wear these jeans. i'm. i'm 5'2", 115 libs and they definitely fit tight in a good way. just like the photo pretty much. they are not small like the white mother ankle fray jeans for sale on the site now. those definitely run smaller so these are true to size with a tight fit.
I live in los angeles and this is the perfect beginning of fall jacket! i've worn it with dresses and with jeans. definitely has enough extra room to slip a hoodie or small seater on underneath when it gets colder. it's soft and stylish. the only downside is that the pockets aren't really deep enough to put anything in.
Nice tee, true red,3/4 sleeves, lacing is a nice touch. good quality and great sale price.
When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it, upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places, the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!
I got this shirt in red and black. both colors vibrant and material of shirt is nice cotton blend. will get lots of use from both shirts.
This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!
I love this shirt so much that i've now bought it in 2 colors -- the olive green and the red. probably would have bought it in black too if i didn't already have enough black shirts. it's both a plain and simple tee, but with the fun lace-up detail at the neckline that keeps it from being boring.  it runs true to size but is very fitted. however, due to the thickness of the material, i didn't feel like any unflattering bumps or lumps were being highlighted, despite how close the shirt fit to my
Don't try this on, if you don't plan to buy it. it feels amazing!!! i bought the black and it is a lovely charcoal color and matches so much.
I like the lace-up trend, but most designs are too revealing. this shirt is super sexy, but not immodest. i bought it in black and am now buying another color. to me, the fabric feels soft and thick, very nice.
Great shirt. the neckline is super flattering. the fabric has some weight to it. right now i am in a "fat stage"...and it still looked good. it will look even better without the midriff bulge! i bought the shirt in black. i'm thinking of ordering it in red...it's that good.
This is a great shirt that goes with everything. it's super sexy and i have to say....the girls look great in it! i bought the black first and went back for the green. the quality of the shirt is great...not cheap and no smell, at least not in my experience,  like was mentioned by another reviewer. i can't say enough about how cute this shirt is!
I purchased this blouse because i love a 70's vibe in my tops. it is a beautiful, colorful top, but the colors weren't flattering on me. having said that, the cut is nice, the fabric is lightweight and flows nicely, and the fit was fine on me. i am a curvy 5'5" with a 36 c cup. go for it if this is a style you like. one other note, i wish it had been a bit longer, but i am older and prefer a little more coverage. it's just a personal preference. i think the picture is an accurate depiction.
This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique, flowing, romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like, fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!
I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work, but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally, i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a "versatile" v and
A breath of fresh air. spring flowers! easy to wear. very feminine and flattering. looks great with denim, orange, reds , etc. very happy with this purchase.
Nice fit and flare style, not clingy at all. i got the grey color, petite large, fits perfect. will wear with tights/boots or booties. lots of color options to accessorize with.
This top is soo pretty with a cool edge. it looks and feels like really good quality.
This dress is flattering in all the right places. it has a gorgeous skirt with a comfortable, form-fitting top. it provides just the right amount of coverage. i love it so much i bought it in two colors!
I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.
This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material. it also runs large.
I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it.. i bought the navy in size xs. the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful, although you don't have to be young to look good in this dress. the dress is fitted, but the skirt flares, making it flattering if you have hips like me. the material is not too heavy so you can wear this 3 seasons fall, winter, spring. as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short. i am 5'9" so it does hit well above my knees. this isn't an is
Extremely flattering. an easy dress to wear - good choice for both day and evening
I took a chance and tried on this jacket today at the store. at first i was worried that it might look boxy on me but as soon as i put it on, it was love at first sight! it's so cute and very comfy! the sleeves are slightly long on me but that's been a recurrent issue regarding all my jackets. i'm only 5'3" about 124 lbs. and it fit me very well. because it's a bit cropped, it makes me look taller. glad the weather is starting to warm up so i can find more excuses to wear it. i didn't need anoth
I tried on the usual xs in the patterned style, and it fit really nicely. the colors are very nice in person, vibrant. teh cut is flatering and gives a nice definition at the waist i also love the lace up neck detailing. the sleeves flutter out, and will give a bit more volume, if i would change something that would be it. i would make the sleeves more fitter or perhaps shirter with the flutter. i am 115 lbs for reference...
I had it on my wish list for a long time, not sure whether i should purchase, i even hesitated when it went on sale, but boy, am i glad i did order it... it is crazy comfortable, flattering, and love that it looks black but is blue... i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots. not too short (i am 5 foot 1.5)... the fake leather part concerned me at first, but i like it now... nothing bad ot say about it!
I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but, i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately, it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal
I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in. it does not disappoint. the flowers are so pretty and it has great style. there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing. the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath. the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape. i can't wait for it to warm up and to wear this!
Perfect trans top.  skinnies or boyfriend and booties.  love the mixed prints
This top reminds me of the special tops i got "once upon a time"...when retailer adopted a more curatorial approach to their store. this is a beautifully-made top...quite dramatic but comfortable. i've received many compliments each time i've worn it. it has wonderful drapery and movement.
This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!
I ordered size small and medium because i can go either way depending on brands. and both look great! there is no significant difference except medium fell about 1 inch longer. i am 5'4" and size small hem fell about 1" above knee. size medium felt tab bit more loose but i thought fabric may stretch a bit after wear so i'm keeping size small. what a beautiful dress! although the body of dress is jersey material, it is lined so there is good coverage. i tend to not like "faux leather" since they
This top is so pretty and feminine. the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse. the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves. the fit is true to size, i usually wear a size medium or 10 in retailer tops and the size 10 fit quite nicely. this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well.
Very cute, very comfortable. for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand. this dress fits the bill.
Very comfortable and versatile. got lots of compliments.
The combination of vintage and bohemian styles seems as if it would be flattering on all figure types. and i love the combination of smaller and larger prints. the only thing i didn't like is that on the blouse i received, placement of the larger print on the bodice is asymmetrical (unlike the photo). it might not bother some customers, but it wasn't what i was expecting, so i ordered a new one. i may keep it even if the second one is off, because other than that small thing, i think the top wou
Saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store. i usually wear an 8 or a 10 depending on how things run, (i'm a 34 dd), so i tried on both sizes. i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get. the 10 was just a tad looser so i went with that one, but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference. it is a very figure flattering top, and a plus that you can machine wash it. simply awesome!
Love love this dress. fits so great. i normally wouldn't have picked this dress. more preppy than my normal style. fits amazing. my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i've ever owned. the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts.
This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!
Beautiful colors, especially the pink. i am 5'3" and about 124 lb. i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs. not only is it short hem-wise, which i don't really mind, but it is short in the waist. very pretty and good fabric.
This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.
A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!
This dress looks great on me. it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and it's easy and comfortable to wear.
I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didn't look very cute. i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on. i'm so glad i did! the inside gray material is so soft. i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all. it is very comfortable. i bought the x-small and was very surprised at how roomy it was. the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up. not sure if the xx-small would've been too small or if the
For me, the tag sale is an opportunity to take a second look at items that i may have overlooked earlier, to pick up something fun at a good price. i found this dress in two colors in my size in the store! i took my usual xxsp at 32-24.5-32. length is perfect - just above the knee and the top is flattering with not too much fabric in the skirt. overall, this is a really cute staple dress. looking forward to wearing it in the spring. larger busted ladies size up. it is meant to be fitted in the t
I absolutely love everything about this dress. it can be dressed up or down. no complaints.
The horizontal lines on the skirt and top gives the wearer and very nice dress. i am short so i got the 6 petite and it fits perfectly. the fabric is thick and stretchy.
This is a great top to pair with jeans to step a casual night up a notch.
The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates. indeed, though, the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and boots.  i like that the dress highlights my hour glass figure, but with a generous nod to my curves with the accommodating skater skirt.  love it! will be easy to wear casually and work appropriate, too. the sale price was a huge bonus.
Top of the line! very well made and on sale to boot. i love the style and received a compliment from my sister when i wore it. i love the layered look.
Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering. paired with a skirt, jeans or cropped black pants- this top is perfect! the cut in the front is not overly deep- so a cami is not necessary. i am usually a l or xl or 12 in retailer tops and i have a 10 in this top. so it is sized slightly larger than usual.
This blouse fit better than i expected. looks great with jeans and is an easy go to top!
I love this top! not sure if i would picked it up in the store; i received it as a gift from my husband. kudos to him as it was a great choice. i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave. really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out. hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality.
I've admired the various iterations of this dress and finally found one in the sale room, much to my delight! i'm generally a sale shopper, so this doesn't mean i didn't think it was priced well. i have the oatmeal top with yellow/gold/orange pattern on the skirt in xs. the small fits comfortably up top, but on my petite frame, the top just looked too big, so i went with xs. i suppose the straps are a bit confusing, but their easy to figure out if you just look at them for a moment before puttin
This dress is comfortable as well as flattering, which does not happen very often! looks good with navy tights too!
Love love love this jacket!! great spring and fall weather.. very stylish!!
I purchased this dress because i have a similar one with a linen skirt from the spring. the skirt on this dress is a heavier fabric and it lays very nicely. the top provides good coverage for my larger chest and i took my typical xs size. i would definitely recommend this purchase.
This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt, but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front, or leave it open. great looking, casual but stylish and neat. a good grey, and a good blue.
I went to my local store and they only had the blue dress in stock, i had seen it online and i didn't expect to like the blue one. i tried it on anyway, and it was adorable! i struggled to choose, but i ordered the gray one at the store and they shipped it directly to me. it arrived quickly and i love it!
This jacket has a nautical look which is a refreshing change for this year. it is double breasted & a stretchy cotton, which i love. i am a big fan of cotton. it appealed to me so much that i ordered both the white & the navy in the regular size small. i am of small build at 5'3", 117# & expected that the sleeves c/b a little long. i avoid ordering petite size jackets b/c sometimes they are snug in the shoulders. ok, so the regular s was a good length at the bottom of my hips, but arms were bagg
This top is gorgeous and versatile. i wear it with jeans and dress it up with a skirt. so happy to have this in my wardrobe.
The jacket is great, the quality is very good and the fit too, the best part is how it looks !
I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2" but 36d and have 31" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the
I just received these pants and i am very pleased.  they are a little longer than i expected them to be, but that actually works out well because now i can wear them to the office.
I was hoping this would go on sale and now it finally has! i loved this dress just as much in person as i have online. the fabric is interesting-it looks almost plastic in the online pictures but don't be fooled, it is still a comfortable fabric. it is almost like lots of diamond pieces were actually sewn together to make this dress and i love it. there is a sipper down the side to make it easier to get into, but also in the back there is bunched up fabric which is made to be ore bendable for th
I tried this dress on and felt amazing in it.  i got home and showed my husband my purchases.  i told him i wasn't sure if i should have bought this one and told him to be honest with me.  he said it looked great and he was glad i bought it.  so great for a spring wedding. fits true to size.  i am 125 5'4" c-cup and i bought my normal size 0.  this made my waist look really small.
This is a very nice jumpsuit; reviewers were correct stating that torso is long & fit better a taller person. as soon as i read the reviews i went on and placed an order for size 8, i'm 6ft tall 160lb and it has been very difficult to find a jumpsuit to fit my long torso. this one however turned out to be perfect! true to size and fit, not only that, the fabric is very soft and good quality, very interesting style of the jumpsuit, looks much better in person! i particularly liked cropped, wide-l
I love , love this top !! it looks just like the picture on model. the front is a soft t-shirt and the back is so cute and flattering . super unique and comfortable style.!! i am 5'4 -105 and xs fits perfect.
This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps...
I love these! they are a perfect addition to my fall wardrobe, and just like all other pilcro jeans, they are a great fit and true to size.
I often have a hard time finding items that fit true to size, but this top fits perfectly. it is cut really well and very flattering.
I'm surprised i'm the first to review this dress! it is a must for the holidays and any special occasion! it is absolutely gorgeous! it is so feminine and seductive; it's one of those dresses that would be stunning on anyone! it is a quality dress, beautifully made, looks just like the photo. i'm 5'9" & the hemline falls at the top of my knees. the neckline is exquisite & really "makes" the dress. i purchased the black version but if i was younger i'd get it in red as it would garner quite a bit
This shirt is very nice quality and looks stunning. it does run tight in the shoulder area and is a bit of a challenge getting off, but as long as i don't rip it one of these times all will be well! it looks so nice on that i overlook that design flaw.
Love this blouse! its so darn cute. the fabric is soft, flows nicely and is just absolutely stunning without being over the top. it falls at the lower part of my hip. the softness of the fabric would make this easy to tuck in. the body of the shirt, sleeves, cuffs and placket are contrasting florals in black and creamy white. the top part is a brownish burgundy color and the flowers/butterflies are embroidered in goldenrod yellow, peach, creamy white, two mauve tones, turquoise and brown. the li
This is a beautiful top. it extended longer than i had hoped and a petite size was not available, so i ended up returning it. but it is beautiful and the tassels on the sides make it truly unique.
Love this blouse! i took a chance on ordering it and wasn't sure what i would think. this blouse is fabulous!!! it has a boho-chic flair to it in a sophisticated way. it's one of those "special" pieces from retailer; elegant, quirky, sophisticated. the details are great, too. of course the embroidery is beautiful; but there are a couple more fun details. the cuffs on the sleeve have multiple buttons; so that you can button them tight or just enough to roll the cuff once. when the cuff is r
Love this top! it is super flattering with a long floaty body. i usually wear a 4 but sized up to a 6 due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a 4 would have fit as well.
Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy. great with jeans/shorts or slacks with a jacket for the office. beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra. front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps it's not that big a deal.
This is truly unique top, the  detail around the neck is a nice change!!!
I am 5'2" 125 pounds and i bought the 4p. the fabric is high quality and does not cling at all but instead drapes and in a very flattering way. add that to the cut of this jumpsuit and you have elongating, very flattering lines. i could not be more pleased and regret not having bought this item earlier, since i would have enjoyed wearing it during the holidays. as other reviewers said, it is adorable and a winner.
Great little transitional piece. i bought the blk/blk floral one & it's not your usual top. sort of quirky & one of a kind looking. i think it's crazy comfortable & i just love it! even its a bit chilly outdoors, toss on a scarf round one's neck & head on out. not the kind of top you'd wear with a jacket.
This top has a western look with lots of black and some burgundy shades.  it is very cute and the fabric is soft.
I was lucky enough to get a hold of this intarsia sweater dress after the sale and i wish i had purchased this the first time round. it is absolutely stunning, flattering, comfortable and unique! i am 5'3" and the regular hem fit me just fine at the ankles. i think this dress runs both tts to a bit large so i would size down if your small framed and stay your usual if your busty or broad shouldered. perfectly complements my taupe booties that i already owned and a my taupe maxi sweater that has
I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great,true to size i am xsmall-small for reference, purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater, or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!
I am returning the dress because it smells heavily of the last purchaser's deodorant and perfume. it was actually nauseating to put on. i am disappointed with retailer that i was sold this dress, full price, in this condition. otherwise, the dress is lovely. it is true to size. i am 5'5" 110 lbs and the size 0 was perfect.
I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers, boots, dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body, and a little loose, but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product.
I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist, but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging, but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch, but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference, i am 5'4", 34/26/38, and i got a 6 regular.
This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!
Perfect fit. did not lose its shape. thicker material. great quality for a great price. definitely  a wardrobe  staple. can be dressed up or down. work (business) appropriate. fits tts. for reference,  i am 5'0", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fits perfect. falls right above ankle like pictured. if they had more colours, i would get them too :)
The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back, as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped, so take care when laundering.
Very comfortable fabric and fits nicely. i am 5'10" like it states the model is, and it falls shorter on me that viewed, but still looks nice. it will be an easy dress to use for different looks.
When i tried on this bathing suit, i decided to not try on any others. it was just right! i usually find bathing suit shopping difficult and no fun--as i can never find a suitable bathing suit. this suit looks nice/flattering, and i can also move around in it and it stays in place. i purchased it in the navy and i'm going to order it in another pattern as well. it looks modern and classic; it's a chic style. i'm a size 6 in dresses, and i purchased a size 10 in this bathing suit.
Love love love these leggings and what an amazing price point!!!
The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described. it is the most comfortable and flattering one-piece i have ever tried on.   as noted by other reviewers, there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift.
I had been looking for a one-piece that is fashionable yet practical. fabric is beautiful, fit is impeccable, no complaints on lack of support. i find if you tie it tight up top it's very practical. this was the perfect choice for me. i am 5'3" 120 lbs and ordered the small.
These sold out in my size 16 before i even knew they existed! (probably a great indication that your in-between and plus-size customers are hungry for more options from you). please restock so i can get in on this apparently-perfect pant!
This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it's comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.
Cute top! the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front. it's a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think it's a flattering shape. i got the regular s and don't find it too short. for reference i'm 5'2", 134 lb, 34b. i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit.
Comfy easy dress. i bought the black version. fabric is so soft. i wear this around house, but don't hesitate to run out in it if needed. i bought medium so it was roomier and for length since i'm tall. small also fit, but was shorter than i wanted.
I had my reservations given that i'm petite (5'2", 108lbs) and it's midi style. i'm glad that i took a chance. i bought the red motif and it's beautiful. it's wrinkle-free right out of the package. the color is vibrant and the style is classic and effortless. fits true-to-size. great for work with a black tee as shown in the picture.
Cute comfortable top. fits well and will look great with skinny jeans.
I purchased this dress in black and love it. its hot where i live so i am always looking for a lightweight dress that i can throw on either after the pool or out and about. i wore it to an outside concert with sandals and a simple braid, it was perfect! considering ordering it in another color!
Perfect fit! can be dressed up or down! more colors please!
These are great pants. i love the fit and the taper of the leg. these will be my "go to" black pants for the fall season!
This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped. i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos, but i ended up liking that better. it is well made with thick (but not too thick) lined material. also, i was initially worried that the deep v-neck may be too deep for my liking, but once i had it on,it looked classic and not showy. i love the suit.
I love these pants. i bought as basic pants to dress up or down and they look good with flats or heels. also i like you can wash instead of dry clean.
These pants are awesome - please make them in other colors besides black and navy!
This is an amazing swimsuit. i had been on the hunt for the perfect one piece. i wanted something a bit on the modest side, but still sexy, and i hoped for a unique print that would make it stand out. the icing on the cake would be a suit that is functional enough to either lay poolside or scuba dive. enter this swimsuit from retailer. i fell in love with the teal dot print as it's unlike anything else i've seen - it's absolutely spectacular in person. i love the vibrant blue and the chic d
I really love these pants. just the right fabric, not too thick. so comfy. i do feel they run a bit big. they stretch out quickly so if you are in between sized, choose the smaller one.
I had been searching for a swimsuit that flattered my baby bump and this is it - i'm in love! for reference, i am 5'6",170-180, 10-12 or m-l depending on the item. however, i'm currently 19 weeks pregnant so im about 185 and growing - so i went with the xl swimsuit. i have a 36c/38d bust and although there is no true support in the top of this suit, it holds the girls in and the deep plunge is just the right amount of sexy. the bottom has modest coverage, showing just a little bit of cheek. i go
I bought the first skirt at the store. loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too!
I put this runs small but it's a little more tts, except the arms are very slim! if you like to push your sleeves up like this model, you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up. length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and i'm a petite. the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters, which i actually prefer. the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters. some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out, but th
Love the fabric fit and cut of this skirt. it hits at just the perfect spot but runs a little large and is more flattering when sizing down (atleast on me) .
This is by far the cutest, most glamorous one piece i have ever tried on! it fits perfectly and is flattering in the right places, it doesn't show too much cleavage and is modest enough for family events. absolutely love this suit in navy. wasn't in love with the rest of the patterns, hoping they come out in more solid colors someday soon!
I don't normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i didn't know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th
I love this ankle length pant. it is so comfortable wear it with a tunic or tee. i can wear this for 3 seasons!
I think this is the first time i've successfully purchased pants online. i normally have to try a bunch of styles and sizes on before i find the right ones. i gave it a shot with these, and bingo! they are great! they are a bit longer on me than on the model, because i am 5'3" and did not order a petite. i still like how they look, hitting just above my ankle. just the right blend of conservative and cool for lecturing in front of college undergrads.
Such cute, soft and comfortable shorts. can be worn as night wear or out and about.
I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture, but they aren't too tight.
Received many compliments the first day i wore them.. amazing fit. disagree with the other post. the quality is amazing. i wish they had other colors. bought xs
This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable, yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique, yet whimsical swimsuit style.
This top is gorgeous! this is why i love retailer the quality is amazing. i just love how unique this top is. it's a light jean blue and white pin striped shirt with these beautiful red crochet sleeves. i'm a 34ddd i ordered the large and it's perfect. it is a bit shorter probably because of my chest but i was going to wear it with high waisted shorts anyways.  it's a must buy!
Sale price is a great price for a cute cover-up.  so this is not a polite company dress.  this is a "i want to show off my cute underwear/bikini/cross-fit bod while i go get a cold pressed juice in venice" kind of dress.  or you can just wear it at home like i do.  runs small btw, so size up.
These fit me really well. i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist. usually, if it fits my legs the waist is too big. the trousers have some stretch for a better fit. the only downside is that i had go them hemmed (bought regular size).
I often find wearing anything described as 'slim' difficult, but these pants are absolutely wonderful. i bought in a size 12 regular length. they are perfect, both in fit and quality.
This midi skirt has a really nice drape with great seasonal colors! can't wait to pair it with my wine color booties!
This is a fabulous style top! highly recommend this top. comfortable material. retailer is consistently tried and true to a classy style!
This dress is gorgeous, but i should warn all the tall ladies out there that it fits quite awkwardly. i'm 5'10" and tried both the petite (thinking it would fall more like a midi), and the regular, hoping it would fit like a maxi should. both hit at a very awkward spot on my mid-shin... as much as i loved and wanted it, it looked too weird to justify buying.
These are the perfect leggings. they're so soft, and they don't stretch and droop throughout a day of wearing them. i ordered the grey and moss, and they have different textures, which is fun.
I never buy anything at retailer full price, but had to get this when i tried it at my local store, especially since it's back ordered for so long. it's very flattering, and super comfortable. fully lined, not see- through at all. elastic waist that's hidden under the sweater top. will be so easy to throw on and dress up for an evening out, or lounge in after a day at the pool or beach. looking at the model pics, i was concerned the arm pit holes came too low, but on me that is not the case. the t
This sweater is unique and really pretty.  i got so many compliments and i felt really girlie wearing it - it is so fun.
I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model, but it's not short. with a long shirt underneath, i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer, and i got this in a medium. i can't wait to wear it all fall and winter long!
Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments. they do fall open when you sit down, though they have liner shorts inside for coverage. they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite.
These pants! great casual pants, i've received so many compliments! mainly because they are flowy, and the open panels make them different! with the weather so hot, they are perfect for keeping you cool. very pleased with this purchase!
Nice basic top...i will get plenty of use out of this! love the neckline.
I'd been eyeing this dress since i first saw it in the dress catalog when it came out. when i saw it in person, it was just as beautiful as i remembered! i'm about 140 lbs and usually wear a size s or m, but i tried the s on and decided to size down to an xs, because the linen flowy fabric lays a bit wide when on the body; however, the s would have worked, too! i'd say size down if you prefer your clothes a tiny bit more fitted. the fabric is beautiful and lightweight, even though there is more
I have been searching for a pale pink sweater for fall. the color and fit is much prettier than the way it is photographed here. i think it will look great over denim, grey, or olive green dresses and shirts.
I got this in blue and also in white, both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does, so consider this when you order, depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way, definitely not with leggings.
I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8"). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!
This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall. i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier - the fabric is pretty lightweight - but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season.
Marking down one star because these pants do gape quite a bit when you sit down, though i appreciate the shorts underneath that prevent any indecent exposure. these could have done with a little stitch in the front or side somewhere on the leg to limit that. that said, my other similar (non-retailer) pants that are much worse and are also are bulkier on top, which does not look great at my size/with my body shape. these are more flattering (i love the band on top) and comfortable. i am normally a
It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a "lightweight sweater." everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks
These leggings are some of the softest i own. i ordered both the black and the moss and each has a distinct pattern. they are perfect for colder climates and fit me like a glove.
So comfy and stylish. love the color, i purchased the indigo/blue. nice fit, relaxed fit....not fitted. might have to get another color. it's fun to have a tee with a different design detail (neckline). i'm 5'7 145-150 lbs and ordered the medium. a smaill probably would have worked too, since my shoulders are a bit narrow. but mediumd is fine:)
I love this sweater! it is true to size and not itchy at all. i am 5'5" and i bought the small. other reviews said it wasn't as long as it looks pictures but it is the same length on me as it shows on the model. you can wear this with so many things! i can't wait for fall so i can wear it.
The coral is stunning. the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you can't see in the picture, it isn't a straight cut. the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans, or dressing down something fancier.
I received this sweater in last week, when i opened the package i thought for sure that this sweater was going to be itchy , it is not , the styling is great and very flattering for the price this is a great value.
I'm a 110 lb, shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge. i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite. the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy - probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me, othewise, it looks a little too boxy. the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely, similar to the model in the pink. i had a sweater with this exact silhouette 5+ years ago and wore it to death even though i
I bought it in the cream color and loved it so much that i bought it in black too. super cute with jeans! can dress it up too. the only slight negative, if i had to find one, is that i feel like i have to pull it forward, at the neckline every once in a while...it doesn't choke me but just feels like it's heavier in the back so pulls a bit. worth it though! :)
This sweater is like a giant hug. i wore it today and received so many compliments.
This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days. great fit; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon, soft cotton with great details. im 5'8 140 ish and the medium fit great. i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now! the white was to sheer for my taste though
I can never resist a peter pan collar, so i bought this top in the ivory. it's so cute! i wore it for the first time today and received many compliments. it's very comfortable, fits well, and looks expensive. highly recommend it!
This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!
I love this dress. i'm 5'8" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist, so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like, i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove.
I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.
I was not impressed with this dress online but when i tried it on at the store i fell in love. it's a great summer / fall dress. i love the sweater top and linen bottom. so many compliments on it!
I needed a tee refresher, i had a good feeling about this one so ordered all three colors when they were on a promo, and i'm not disappointed. the neckline is different and works great to emphasize your favorite necklace. the tee holds shape after washing and drying. my favorite is the blue which i like to wear with dark wash jeans as styled on the model. the white has a cream tinge to it and i'm able to wear it with a nude bra without looking indecent. there is a cute little button detail at th
I found this sweater to fit me just as pictured. i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. it hits length wise the same as pictured and is just as flowy with a lot of fabric. super cute with a grey top, white skinnys and brown leather sandals. love it!
This dress is everything. i'm 5'4, athletic build, 36d and the medium fit me perfectly. the colors are really understated and beautiful and can easily be dressed up or down. i wish the elastic around the waist fell a little lower but that's one of those things only i notice and definitely didn't keep me from falling in love and buying it. can't wait to wear it on vacation next week!
I love this cardigan! i ordered the pink and it's a really pretty color. i wish it didn't run so big but xs will be cozy all winter.
This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.
This top has a comfy cozy feel while still being flattering. i especially like the generous neckline--adds a uniqueness to it. great shirt for dressing down, but still feeling feminine. i bought two! my husband always compliments me when i wear it.
I love this sweater. it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. i live in minnesota, so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential. this sweater fits the bill. i love how soft and warm it is, the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional (warm and cozy). i love anything with pockets, which this has. i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short. i did not find that to be true for me, and i ordere
Can be a bit itchy sometimes, i guess depending on your skin. haven't had a problem with the sweater up to now!
This dress is perfect. i'm literally wearing it right now. it's crazy comfortable while still being flattering. it looks and feels high quality, and just barely doesn't hit the floor. it makes me feel like a goddess. plenty of room in the bust area, even for me (36dd), and doesn't show bra straps or underwear. highly recommended!
I love this shirt. it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun. it's very soft and comfortable. i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors.
I love this shirt. the neckline is flattering and the overall feel is very comfy.
I wasn't going to purchase this dress because it was given 1 star. however, i ordered it and i was so glad i did!!! i'm 5'1, 105lbs this dress fit me perfectly, it really compliment my petite body. i get so much compliments! it is not easy to order anything for a petite frame but this dress really show off my body without showing too much.
I tried this on in the store and had to have it. this is the kind of sweater that you just want to cozy up with on a nice fall or winter day with a cup of coffee in hand. i love the neutral pink color as it will go with everything. i'm a dress and skirt girl and this will go well with those items. it will cover your bum and i love the dolman sleeves. i highly recommend it!!
Bought this today - cant speak to wear - but overall design is so incredibly cute and flattering. i am usually a small or medium, but went with a medium. so different and wearable! white is sheer so opted for a denimy blue color that i dont see listed available online.
I love these tights so much i almost want to buy another few pair and save them for when these wear out. the lining is like clouds on your calves. they're thick enough that you don't need to be totally covered by a tunic but slim enough that they don't add bulk. love, love them!
There's are just what i was looking for! these are perfect in texture and thickness...not too thick but not too thin. super soft fleece on the inside. i both both the black and green...i will most likely but the grey soon enough.
Adorable, comfortable dress. the denim is super soft with a bit of stretch. please be advised this dress runs very large, especially through the hips. i normally wear a size 12 and the large was swimming on me. i will definitely be exchanging it for a smaller size.
I am long waisted and 5' 120 lbs. 34c. that being said, i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly. a petite would have been far too short. so i would recommend a regular size if you're a petite. also i have a big chest and this was very flattering. because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck, but this classic peter pan collar looks great! i purchased the black. i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave. the black and white o
This is a bit pricey, but it's the most beautiful sweater that i own. it fits beautifully, and the material is soft, not itchy, which is important for a sweater with a cowl neck. the cowl sits beautifully, no matter how you "fold" it. and, the pattern both at the neck and the bottom is vibrant and bright, and is just lovely. i ordered a small and it covers my butt, which is perfect for leggings, or even with tights and boots. it's not shapeless, but seems to graze your thighs, and has a mild tur
This product i better than the pic. nice fit and a nice throw on with boots nap glad i took a chance one it
I bought this a month ago and returned it. but kept thinking about it so ordered it. it arrived on wed and i wore it on thursday as a dress with tights. i got so many compliments on it. it was perfect for the cool weather and was not too warm.  this knitter thinks the quality of the jacquard knit is excellent. yarn used is top notch.
I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!
I absolutely love this sweater! first of all, it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top, but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length, which i normall
Has quickly become one of my 'go to' tops. comfortable, cute, looks just like the picture.
I saw this dress in the window at the portland store, and had to try it on. i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it on--sort of like wearing a tent. no shape at all. one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt, and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress i've ever had on. it's romantic, elegant, feminine... the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic. i can't say enough about how amazing it makes me feel. i wore
Love this blouse! the top is true to size...i'm generally a m and decided to try a pl which fit great. the pm was just a bit snug...looked fine but i felt a little constricted in the bust area and thought the pl was better for me. i'm 5'1" for reference and curvier on top than on bottom. i wore a nude bra when trying on and it totally worked with this blouse. the lace detail is a bit sheer in some parts near the bust line but nothing too inappropriate. i can't wait to wear it down to dinner for
This is a beautiful and fashionable blouse. it feels good on as it is made of viscose, it is pretty and feminine. color is great, of course it needs to be your color. i love it and recommend it!!
This dress is light, airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan.  this dress is a keeper!
Great tank to wear to work or a night out. fits true to size.
Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top. as soon as i put it on, i was amazed at how pretty it is. i'm 5'3" and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size. i would say if you are between sizes, you may want to size down. i didn't have any issues with the lace and the slight v-neck falls perfectly on me. no need to wear any cami.  my only concern was how wrinkled the top was. i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin
Not only a beautiful knit but can be worn as both tunic and dress on my short frame. it does not look like a sack tent when worn. very soft and flattering. collar is styled well and can be shaped different ways. pattern and color combo is the similar to the exquisite eira dress. i am 5'3" and i chose the regular over petite. i only wish the sleeves were longer.
As others have said, this is even prettier in person. beautifully made, colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium, depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large, it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings.
I love this top! the sizing was great, and i have already worn it so many times, and received so many compliments! it is great to dress up or down! such a great purchase!
Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.
Very slimming, lovely dress. a nice addition to your fall/ winter wardrobe. the embroidery is lovely, fabric soft and comfortable. sized perfectly.  so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!
New fav lbd. i am 5 months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again. it fits right above the waist, with a bow to cinch the waist. love the fit and flare. the top is warm, great for a cold evening out. and the taffeta really dresses it up. love
After reading the reviews, i was hesitant to purchase, but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand, but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!
Comfortable,t eh fabric is very soft. the embroidery adds a little to the otherwise plain black tunic. lace up neck on trend too.   i ordered the xxs p, as it is likely loose... that was just fine for me, xs p would have been not as flattering. theo nly problem with that is the sleeves then became a little more snug (workout arms). not too snug that i can't wear the dress, but decided not to keep it only because there are way too many things i like at retailer! (and have to pick). in my wish lis
I bought this in black and it did require me to wear a shirt underneath as it was a little sheer/see through. i usually wear an xs and i wore the same in this top. the black is very pretty and goes well with some skinny jeans.
This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'2 so i ordered the petite, but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings, with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs, but ordered the s, based on the size chart, it's a perfect fit.
It is so simple but elegant and beautiful! i am 5'3 and 120 lb and extra small fits me perfectly
I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper, this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee, so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath.
I love the soft, slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. don't expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order, the green version had sold out. as it turns out, the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today, but i wore it anyway!
Unusual color. expensive even on sale.
I am 5'4" 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect, and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron
The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.
I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $68 for a basic top like this.. but for the sale price they are great! comfortable, lightweight, and flattering. the black is a little sheer, but nothing a tank underneath can't solve. a good buy!
I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder, loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories.
Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too "baggy" or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots, but it would also look great with flats, heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!
I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4", 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha
Love this dress! it is super-flattering, and the embroidery is beautiful.
I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said, it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly, albeit a little short. for reference, i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses.
Absolutely gorgeous skirt! so feminine and curve hugging. wish i hadn't found this so late! want it in every imaginable color, but i will settle for the off white.  please bring this style back!
Great style!
This top is great - lightweight and flattering. i can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans.  i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much.
Can be dressed up or down. the top part is tight, while the bottom has a beautiful skirt. i'm slightly busty and about 5'6" and the size 6 is perfect for me.
Love this shirt! i bought the light blue color and its amazing, fits well i love that its long in the back. very comfortable and loose. thinking of buying it in both pinks.
Love this cardigan. fits just as i expected. very structured in the front with a bit of flair in the back.
This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color, not close to red, but it will work well with black, gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.
I bought this tunic in black and am seriously considering buying it in more colors. it is so comfortable and very flattering. i am 5'11", so many tunics are more like shirts on me, but this one is the perfect length to wear with leggings or pants. the v neck is a nice, feminine touch and i love the change in material around the edges.
I am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and "slips" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy, but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s
These leggings are soft, comfortable and go with everything. love the way they feel.
I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however, had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l
This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.
I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!
I ordered these in both the grey and moss, and i love both. they are very soft, very easy, loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured, so they hit lower on my leg than on the model, which i prefer in these. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile, like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine, cold, laid flat to dry), touched up with light steam from
Love these pants. corduroy leggings that fit like a skinny pant. comfortable. not too stretchy. maintains shape, even with multiple wears between cleaning. pairs nicely with black, neutral, or buttery yellow tops. fun print. received compliments first time i wore them. sizing is just right also. i'm 5'3. usually wear 26 in denim but have to go up a size for super skinny so i ordered a 27p which fits me just fine.
These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy, have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big, i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall, highly recommended.
Beautiful pajama bottoms. i purchased these as a special treat for myself. luckily, i found a review on another site, stating that these run small, before pirchasing. no one wants tight pjs. order a size up! also, i'm 5'8" tall and the length is just right. if you are taller, you may find this style too short. i haven't ordered the top, because i'm not sure of the fit, but i'm guessing it also runs small, based on the photo.
I bought this top in my usual size in a small. i'm a 34 d 26 waist. i absolutely love it. i pair it with a red cardigan. very cute.
I love this sweater combo! as a larger woman, i am always looking for flattering tops. the draping in front covers all the right areas! i wish they made them in more colors!
This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.
When i saw this online, i thought it was going to be a thin, summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it. it is not thin and wispy, but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it. definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings. the zipper pockets look cool too, would definitely recommend!
This is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt. it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted. i had to size 1 size down. really nice.
Wow, i can't believe there were some sizes left at my local store. it was on sale and i maxed out with additional discount for black friday week-end. the size 6 fit perfect and i can't wait to wear. this is a gorgeous skirt and will sell out for sure.
I love the fabric, since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance. this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric. the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down).
This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online, but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day, the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted, and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.
This was on display when walked into my local retailer, it's just a beautiful in person. my mistake was trying it on, instant love! i tried on my usual size small & it fit perfectly. i would usually wait for something in this price range to go on sale, but i just had to have this. worth the splurge!
These are the best fitting jeans i've ever owned! no puckering near the crotch, and i don't need to have the waistband taken in. they probably run small.
This dress is so beautiful, the color is even more vibrant in person, a stunning emerald green. it is well made and doesn't go too low under your arm, which sometimes happens with halters. the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support. the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top, look at the back view photo online, you can see it there. at first i was surprised by it because i didn't see that on the front view, but then i decided it was fun and flirty. i received numer
These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.
This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the "red" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed
I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and i'm glad i did. it's now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning. i've worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt. so soft and flattering. i got it in the red, but am tempted by the blue!
These pants are 100% true to size (whatever that means anymore...i'm a 26 in paige and ag.  i'm 5''6, weigh around 115, have long legs and i ordered the 0p.  the zero petite are still a little long, with a slight heel they're perfect.  they don't have stretch in them, but do to the fit and fabric...the material does expand, because they're thin and breezy.  i absolutely love them.  can't wait to order other colors of the same style.  these are my new favorite pants.
I ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower.  the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long. so glad i made this purchase.
Don't pay attention to the less-than-flattering photo. these jeans are super cute and very flattering. they are actually long, not ankle length as the photo implies. high waisted with a 70s bell bottom vibe. nice light denim for year round wear. they fit like a dream.
I got this skirt in the dove grey, which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver. it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you can't see in the photo. the other layer is the grey netting. it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner. i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should. i'm 5'3, 102. the skirt looks just as it is pictured, i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit. very very pretty and well made. i'm happy with the purchas
Really loved this - so soft and snuggly. was unsure about ordering shirt size - (s) or jacket size for layering (m). ordered a small. fits perfect! definitely wouldn't have wanted the medium. 5'4, 135 lbs for reference. love this one!!! great find.
Love these jeans! they are the perfect relaxed fit; not too baggy, and a straight style. i did size down, because i wanted to wear them as shown. i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips. glad i did! i usually wear size 29/6 and took a 28 in this pair. the color and denim weight is also great.
I ordered this dress for my daughter. she wore it to a wedding and it was beautiful. looks just as it does in photo. fabric is a nice weight and hangs great. my daughter had her hair done and look right out of an retailer catalog. well made true to size beautiful dress!!!!!!!
Layered this with a chunky sweater and a pair of kicks. it can be low key or dressed up with a pair of heels, multi-functionality not just occasional. it&#39;s feminine, funky, and fabulous!! i bought the last one in the store!
The colors are richer than shown- very vibrant. this piece is very unique and everthing that i love about retailer! i usually wear a medium in jackets and vest. i tried the small and there was very little difference from the small or the medium fit, so i went a size up, just for a looser look. it is very flattering and will be a great addition to my fall wardrobe!
An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.
I bought this tee in all 3 colors, and wish there were more!  fabulous quality, material and style.  can dress up or down; wear with jeans, pants or skirts.  wear alone or layer.  don't miss out on this addition to your wardrobe!
I'm very short and thus not usually into maxi skirts since most of them make me look frumpy, but i ordered this skirt based upon all the great reviews. this skirt is more amazing in person. at first, the material feels a bit stiff and the gold is a lot more shiny in person. but, as usual, moulinette knows how to put things together. when worn, everything comes together, the pleats and the length flow beautifully and the gold shimmers in a subtle way. the skirt runs large (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 h
Sits at waist, length is perfect for petite, quality is very good, looks very nice on me, very recommend
Cute jeans! flattering and slimming. tts. the cut of the top makes my butt look flat, but oh well, they are super comfy. they are not as short on me as they look on the model. i'm 5;9"
Love it! the pants is absolutely beautiful, rich material, it's not your cheap jogger! i am really considering buying a second pair just in case i used my a little to much. fits perfect, i am 5'4" 114lbs and purchase the regular small.
Purchased these jeans in a 27 and i am usually a 28 in skinny jeans. i got the 26's on but they were snug. these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist. great jeans!
I purchased the coral version, and the color is wonderful and vibrant. it fit my daughter beautifully, and she is 5'10". i think she will be wearing this coat often, she loves it!!! she is 23 years old and has a professional job, so she will look the part.
I'm in love, i'm in love.  this dress was gifted to me, because i was gawking at it so often. i love it!!! i am petite, 5'3" 118 pounds and i could do either the small or extra small. the small was a little more comfortable, because the extra small was a bit tight in the arms-but i went with the extra small anyway. in both cases the neckline showed a small amount of tasteful cleavage and i felt like a model with how many people complimented me on it. many people even took the extra step in compl
Very comfortable dress, with a gorgeous pattern. it comes with a self liner in navy that is very smoothing - i was worried a figure hugging sweater knit would be unflattering. cut is perfect. i'm a size 10/12 on top and 12/14 on bottom, and the m was the best fit. the neckline is a deep scoop so if you are not busty it may come down too far for comfort.
I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small, but returned and exchanged for a medium, which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.
These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down, and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.
This is an absolutely gorgeous dress that stands out everywhere i go. it runs true to size and has a slimming effect because of the detail running down the sides.
First, i've been in love with this dress for months. when it went on sale i absolutely had to have it! i'm 5'4" and 150 pounds and typically wear large stuff from retailer but after reading other reviews i decided to get the medium. it's more generous than i expected and wonder if i could've even gone with a small. i might try a belt. either way i'm very very happy with the dress. the sleeves are not too long - and i didn't get the petite because i wanted the length in the skirt. the lining makes
The sweater coat is a must try on! it's a great fall to winter coat, that you can leave on all day if you need. i bought the dark green, which is very dark yet gorgeous and have the beautiful coral saved in my cart as well. i am 5'5", 135lbs, 34c, ordered the size small and have plenty of room (did not want it tight and wanted to be able to wear over thick layers).
Just purchased this coral coat today. the color is beautiful. the quality is excellent and the coat itself is lightweight,great for travel. great purchase and would recommend buying. going to new york and can't wait to wear it . love, love this coat
I guess this is a true to size, i am usually a 30dd and ordered 32d, fits great. the back is really pretty, so even though it is a tiny bit looser, i decided to keep it...
Saw this in store in coral color and new i had to try. love. it's the perfect, cozy cute sweater, color is beautiful and fit is great. i am 5 5" 135 lbs and i tried both the small and extra small. i went with the xs for a more flattering fit. i love it.
I really did not need another coat at all, but i couldn't resist. got it in green - it's dark and woodsy,something robin hood and his merry men could wear in the forest to look and feel their most stylish. the structure is just right - this coat is soft, cozy and fluid, but also tailored enough to wear in a business casual environment... equally well-suited to wear on winter eve dog walks, to a football game, or at the coffee shop for a latte at an outside table. works with most of my wardrobe -
It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint, but it's totally worth it. this is a fabulous sweater coat. i receive compliments on it wherever i go. so cozy, warm & delicious. not too hot to wear indoors either. it's breathable. love it. bought in green during black friday sale. highly recommend.
Omg - wish it came in more colors,,
This dress has a beautiful fit; eyed it for awhile--snatched it up at the dress sale! only drawback was the edging around the neck; on some, the cream-patterned fabric was used and it was distracting. hunted around at stores, but ended up getting lucky with online purchase.
Absolutely beautiful. as soon as i saw the color i had to have it. looks great. i am 5 ft 2 in the color is beautiful. excellently made. very comfy. hood is not bulky
I've been a fan of the pilcro chinos for years but the jeans have not been the right fit for me - usually wind up too big in the waist to accommodate the hips. well the em is aptly named as they are made to fit a girl! ! i usually wear a 29 and the 29 fit comfortably and i could probably even go down a size. thank you retailer - please make more in this style!
What a well-designed dress! the cut is a slight a-line without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming. the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather. the neck is pretty wide, as others have noted, but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent. it does run a little large. i'm 5'5"/130lbs and went with the xsp.
I was initially attracted to the colors
I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale. it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist. it is very comfortable, and made of a nice, soft fabric. i am a 34a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i don't find the neckline too low. i plan to wear it with tights and booties. i am 5' 4" and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees. going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress!
This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!
I adore this hooded boiled wool sweatercoat in rich, deep green. quality is great aside from the buttons being sawn on very loosely. it's a great outer layer in the warm northern california fall/winter. i'm wearing it today with a short sleeved boiled wool dress in burgundy for pre-christmas eve cocktails and feeling classy, festive, cozy, and warm.
Every year i'm excited when the weather gets cool enough for sweater dresses. i love this one, with the longer length, slimming fit and pattern placement, and cozy soft fabric. delightful, inspires reveries of castles and legends (yes i looked up what "eira" stands for and went with it). highly recommended. fit is generously tts.
I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.  the fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming
This sweater dress is lovely, quirky and comfortable. because i have broader shoulders, the neckline was perfect on me, although i probably will end up wearing a scarf to keep my neck warm! the dress skims in a very flattering way. at first i was dissapointed it wasn't more formfitting, but it drapes very nicely. (i usually wear a size four in dresses and chose the small in this dress which was best i think.) it has a built in slip that is a bit flimsy, so i will probably wear a long silk one th
Cute and comfortable! i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is!
So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.
This jacket is worth every penny! it is light enough to wear when like 55/60 out or good when it is in the 40s with a sweater underneath. the fit and design of the coat is amazing! i love the full collar look - that's my favorite detail of the jacket. loved the green so much, i bought the coral too! i normally wear a 12/14 in clothes and the large was perfect!
I ordered this coat in the "pink" color. actually, it is a coal color (papaya) and will be wonderful with gray, black, khaki, and great with animal print accessories. the fit is just as it looks online, no surprises. this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned. the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned. the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it. (much softer than the boiled wool geiger jackets, for anyone who remembers them)  one concern: since the wool is light
Here's the thing: this is a sweatercoat. it's not a coat. it's not something i'll be able to wear independently by the end of november, though i'm enjoying doing so now. it's boiled wool, and not lined, and though it's cozy and warm enough for a morning walk to the train in the high 40s, its role is going to end up being a mid layer. i'm also enjoying wearing it over both dresses and pants at work, serving as a kind of cardigan/blazer combination. i purchased the pink, which i saw online first a
Best jeans ever! it's so hard to find a good petite jean. you shop and shiop and then pay $30 more to get them altered. the fit and length on these are perfect. love, love, love!!!
Received these as a christmas gift from my daughter. just wonderful - warm and cozy and cute. size m is just a tad baggy; i'm sure i could have worn small, but no matter. i wear these often and love them! such a treat!
Every year around this time, our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat. i've seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves!!! this coat is a dream. not too thin and not too thick...it's the perfect layering piece. the fabric has perfect stretch in it. the colors are lovely (i ended up with the cream color, but i loved the green too!!) in many sweater coats i prefer an xl, but because of the stretch the l was just perfect. i'm 5'8 and it hits wel
I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size. i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased. the fit is roomy enough to layer, but not too large or boxy. the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal. i get compliments every time i wear it..."classic," "fancy," "jackie o." are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater. the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e
Super soft and comfortable. runs a little large. very cozy.
Wear the collar down & it favors grace kelly. pull it up and it's an oversized hood. this lightweight cozy piece combines everything i love about a sweater & a coat in one.
Warn and super soft. love it !
Love the high waist, prewashed softness, and relaxed fit. i normally wear a 27 in pilcro but sized down to a 26. for the first time in ages i have a pair of jeans that won's slide down because of the high waistline. i would never tuck anything in so it doesn't matter that it's high waisted but i don't have to worry about them sliding down over my muffin top. worth every penny.
I saw this and tried to wait for it to go on sale, but it sold so fast, i wanted the black and i check everyday until they had my size, i love this coat main because of the wait it goes around the neck since i am not a scarf person, this is very cute, im glad i got it, even at the full price.
These joggers are gorgeous--you can even dress them up! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking. the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering. really, i knew the minute i saw them, i would love them. but, i do have to say that the lovely model wearing them ---the model with the wine colored shirt and the awesome red bag (i bought that too!!!)and that big smile sold me!. many thanks to retailer--personal stylists carolyn and blair. always so helpfu
I love sweater knit dresses and this the first one i've owned with a flare style that works. pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a non-obvious way. i think the fabric is soft and warm. i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint. you may want to size down if you're not busty. i am 5'3" and m petite was the perfect length on me. shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in 1.5 days?!?!?!!!
I have this wonderful sweater coat in three sizes (s,sp,m) in the coral, green
Oh my goodness! i just received this coat tonight. i love it! it is beautiful and stylish. i got the green which is amazing. i'm 5'2" - weigh 115. ordered both s and xs. i'm keeping the s - more room in case a heavier sweater. get this! it's a classic! you will smile!
I wasn't sure what to expect with these pants. i couldn't figure out from the pictures what the material would actually be like. is it jersey? is it french terry? is it more traditional sweatshirt-type material? nope, turns out, they're like wearing pants made out of a fuzzy, flecked sweater. or like the thickest, loosest sweater-knit tights ever. surprise! they are the strangest pants i've ever owned, for sure, but i actually really like them. they're super comfortable and cozy warm. slightly i
This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top, bigger in the hips) that i couldn't pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...i'm normally an extra small, but it was a little snug in the arms. however, the small was too big, so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite, but the store didn't carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress.
Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days. i love the squishy soft feel of the material. it works well with sweaters. love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet. i love how simple and practical this coat is. the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head.
I have broader shoulders and thick arms, this dress does an amazing job slimming my arms and not making me appear top heavy! i'm 5'4 125 lbs, the xs fit perfectly
This bra is so well made and fits beautifully.
Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your "normal" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love
Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!
I bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think it'd be great with some leggings and boots as well. if you want a more structured look go a size smaller. i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large. the coral is beautiful
At first, i thought this sweater might be too boxy, but fastened at the waist, it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing, and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.  but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas, and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.
I love this dress. will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow. it fits well. the neck line is a bit low on me. i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have. i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it (as shown on model). i am 5' 6.5" and 120 lbs and the small is just right.
Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky, which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.
Purchased this sweater in the blue color which is a gray/blue. it runs large as the xs is still quite roomy on me in the body. although the arms are more snug. great quality.
I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter, and i am so glad i did. the colors are beautiful, and the material is so soft. i'm sure she's going to love it!
I fell in love with this top (sweater) before it could even be ordered - was on model for pants that were available to order. in any case, i later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person. the blue also contains fibers of wine - so very pretty. the gray is a soft shade. the quality is lovely too. the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy, but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous. however, that said,
Love the feminine styling of a classic tunic tee! i'll wear it with black leggings this fall. super cute to wear casually or dress up a bit with some jewelry and/or a scarf.
This top is full of amazing details. the photos really don't do it justice. it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue. i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5'5" frame but because of the detailing...it just works.
Unlike the first three reviews, i loved this sweater. the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords. i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable. fits trus to size.
Great fit even for busty women. ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses.(36d-dd) fit nicely without being tight. might have been able to size down but i didn't want to risk being too tight. flattering especially on curves. nice for contemporary office or special occasion. if you like his designs, you won't be disappointed!
Love this top, purchased it in the coral color now i'm definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall. the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather. i'm sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great. fit true to size.
Absolutely love this suit. the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to. it does not ride up at all, which almost never happens with swim suits. i'm going to order this in a different color next season. i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments.
I just love this dress.  took me ordering a number of sizes- petite and regular to find the best fit.  i might still have the top altered.  i received a lot of compliements.  work it with some black leather wedges for daytime/work.
I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!
Love the color! very soft. unique look. can't wait to wear it this fall
I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater.
I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!
This sweater is perfect for transitioning into fall as it is not too heavy. it's flattering and looks great with jeans.
I'm an xl but ended up buying this in a size large. i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front. i also really like that this is cotton, and even though it is heavy and substantial, the thread gauge is a fine weight. while this says i can hand wash the sweater, i'm reluctant to because i'm worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape. i don't care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck, but my hair hides that. overall,
I got the pink version to layer with spring clothes. i always wear a medium, but sized down to a small based on the other review. the seams are very flattering. the material is very soft. on sale, the price is reasonable.
I love this shirt so much i am ordering the coral too! the weight of the material makes it hang nicely. there is a lot of material but it lends itself to the flowy style. i got many compliments of this top!
This sweater is perfect! finally a sweater that doesn't make me look like a huge box!  i bought the blue & it has other colors running through it so i'll be able to wear it with chinos & jeans. very pretty, flattering & i think i'm going to be wearing this a lot.
True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading, looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue "jeans"; perfect outfit for almost all occasions.
Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen, cotton, and acrylic, so it's not heavy, it's weighty. anyways, it seemed to run large just due to gravity, so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.
Okay this shirt is soooo comf. it is super fun and flowy. but it runs large. get one size smaller than you would usually get! so worth the sale price!!!
Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.
I would highly recommend this top. i usually wear a small petite. but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly. there is a lot of fabric, but if you size down it wasn't an issue for me. i weigh 120lbs and am 5 feet tall. also, i'm busty, 34 d. which worried me with this type of top. not a problem. i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this. i am very picky and i was happy with the quality. the fabric is not heavy. it's a fantastic purchase!
I loved this but hesitated to order since i'm petite and busty and assumed it would be an awful mess in the chest area (too tight, gaping etc) but it is great!!! it fits perfectly! there is plenty of room in the chest and the dress is not too long! i ordered a pm and its wonderful. the dress is not see through at all. love it!!!!!
I just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful! it's actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture. there's different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib, the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small (34d-27-35) so it runs tts and i didn't find this overly blousy myself though that's just part of its charm. you'll need an undershirt or something
I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as "orange", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit.
This swimsuit completely exceeded my expectations!  i'm 5'2", 140 lbs with an athletic build, and the cut of this swimsuit is ultra slimming! with the way the top wraps it makes my torso look much longer and leaner than it actually is :) i bought the top in a small and the matching bottoms in medium.   the material is thick, high quality, and the colors are exactly the way they appear online.  the top is reversible and the alternate side is teal and nude. i feel like i got 4 tops in one sinc
As soon as i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. i just tried it on and it is beautiful. i feel gorgeous and glamorous! i can't wait to wear this to a special event as it truly deserves that attention.  the silk is soft and the slip underneath is perfect. the tie in the back perfectly cinches the dress and the pleating is a wonderful detail to the look.  i am 5'0", 110, and i purchased the small petite. it's slightly big around the armholes and it kind of poofs / puckers out so i'm going to
I love how soft and cozy this sweater is. the addition of some cashmere in the yarn makes all the difference. the red color is beautiful also, perfect for the holidays. flattering cut in the back (it dips down to cover your bum) and the pointelle details are very pretty. fit was tts
This top is such a great investment piece. looks classy and is comfortable all at the same time. it is pricey but you will not regret buying this. goes great with light trouser denim or i have the green pilcro khakis. it will he something you will keep in your closet for a long time.
I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it.
I live in south florida so i'm always looking for sundresses that will be flattering (but not too clingy or hot), and that i can take from day to evening with accessories. when i pulled this out of the box and walked around in it, it met all my criteria, and as an added bonus, my husband said, "wow! you look great! where'd you get that dress?" i'm shocked because as an earlier reviewer said, this dress doesn't seem like much - it's not even lined. but it's comfy, flattering (in all the right pla
This shirt fits very true to size, with very soft and comfortable material that hangs just right. wears well and is versatile for many occasions. please come out with more colors so i can purchase them as well!
I saw this dress on line and knew i wanted it for the spring/summer season. i ordered it almost immediately and i am so glad i did. the photo on the website doesn't do it justice, there are a lot of pretty pastel colors in the paisley pattern that you just can't see on the computer screen. the wrap styling is a very flattering cut for most figures especially hourglass figures like mine and the dress fit's tts (for reference i am 5'9" and a 36ddd). the silk material is very light and flowy and wi
Great that it's hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets.
I love the style and quality of this blouse. it can easily be dressed up or down. the blouse is completely see through and delicate. still, it is so romantic, feminine, distinctive and timeless.
Comfortable and great fit and color. high quality.
I haven't worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it, hoping that it'll fit me.   i love the swing skirt and the halter. this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood. there is a side zipper.   i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model. it is unlined but with the color of the dress, i don't mind it.
Bought this blouse to wear with high wasted jeans and pants. it lays beautifully and can be dressed up or down. it's somewhat sheer, but i don't plan on wearing a cami under it. perfect for work or going out.
I definitely recommend this shirt. it's lights and airy, something you can wear everyday.
This top is really cute and true to size. i like the color and the nice details.
I'm 5' 0" and 120 pounds. this top is beautiful. it's high neck is so flattering. a nice switch it up for us gals that are older and like neck coverage sometimes. i purchased a small and it is a little longer, but since it has elastic at the waist it's no problem. i will tuck it in my jeans and skirts. the arm holes are perfect. the as far as it being a lot of blouse, i didn't find that at all. but i am busty, 34c or d depending on brand of bra. the color is ivory. omits completely sheer, no lin
Tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top. i went down one size since i am a true petite. they were sold out of the petite small, but the regular x-small fit perfect. it is a little short so it's perfect for shorter people,
These joggers are soo cute. they fit great!! i seriously love them!! i have worn them so often i may have to ban myself from them for a week. i am 5'4 and the length was perfect for a jogger pant. i got an xs because the small looked too baggy.  the xs loosened up a little after wearing them and are perfect.
I bought these in the olive green, in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online. i am 5' 9" and 145 lbs, long legs and these are beyond adorable. some people mentioned that they stretched out? i did not find this to be true. what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down. they are flattering and perfect for the spring/summer. i would highly recommend and would/will purchase in every color. well done retailer!! one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring.
I was so impressed with the style & boning on the sides for the perfect fit! it's truly a classic staple in your closet for that lbd!!
I was surprised how soft and comfy the fabric is on this top. when i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off! it's a little bigger than i would like - i got a small, and am usually between xs and s. may have sized down if the top were available.but the fit and cut are flattering.
I usually wear a size 8/10 and i needed a large in this skirt. it flows so beautifully!
I love this little number. the quality is terrific, the weight is perfect, and the cut is superb. i love the way it fits and looks in the arms. i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect. i like that it is cool and flowy, without looking like maternity attire. i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another. i was about to order what looks like a yellow one, but i noticed the color is labeled "chartreuse". can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in "real life"?
One of 3 pair of leggings ordered and the only pair to fit properly! size l was perfect for me. they stretched nicely going on and the beautiful floral design on the legs didn't get distorted or faded looking from the stretch. wearing these makes me happy :)
These leggings are beautiful! so unusual and colorful, comfortable, and flattering. they fit true-to-size with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape. the fabric is a bit lighter-weight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque. i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesn't mind attracting a little (envious?) attention.
I totally love this tank! the yoke detailing is so pretty! i read the other reviews...i feel it fits pretty tts, it's what i expected. i have already worn it several times since it arrived in the mail. i love it so much, i'm ordering it in the turquoise color as well. every time i have worn it, i have received compliments. i've worn it alone with shorts and/or jeans, as well as with a cardigan and dress pants for work. it's soft, comfortable and to echo what another review stated, the material s
Gorgeous cobalt blue color!!!  usually s/m- bought the small (because of larger armholes).  so glad i snatched this one up on sale!  the detail on the top is amazing.
I adore these little joggers. i was immediately drawn to the color (army green) and the little details. i carry all my weight on bottom, so i don't often wear many retailer bottoms (i'm usually a 16). i tried the xl on just to see how they would work and i was pleasantly surprised! they are absolutely perfect. they fit a little baggy, as joggers do, and go with just about everything! mine did loosen a tad, but not like the previous reviewer. i highly recommend these! can't wait to wear these throu
Love this tank. it has an easy fit that hides my post baby belly with out looking to wide.
I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer, but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware, this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge
I wanted a casual, denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight  and this skirt fit my needs perfectly.  i'm 5'4, 117lbs and the xs fits me true to size, hitting about 1 1/2 inches above the knee. it's a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath. the raw edge is subtle (no hanging threads) and unique. i can't speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility .
I love this top!! the detail on front top of the top is so cute. the length is just right. i hesitated because of the unusual armhole shape but they are really not an issue. also, thanks for finding the top as it wasn't available at distribution center, went of your way!!
These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.
Great lightweight summer top that's bra friendly.  i bought the teal color yesterday and wore it today with white skinnies.    i'm sometimes a small and sometimes a medium and was fine with the small on this one
This is not something i would normal wear but the beauty of the fabric made just give it a try. i am so glad i did. the fit is beautiful slimming feminine fit with just enough flow. i love it and bought it right away. you better get it before it's gone. also it is true to size, i have along torso so sometimes i have issues with jumpers but not this one.
These undergarments are comfortable, streamlined, and well made. this bra holds up well without wires. i am a 34b and wear a small. it is a bit tight at first, but form fits after one wear. . after trying one bra and i ordered 4 more. then i researched the brand and bought camis to match. i love how all the colors and styles are interchangeable.
I tried this jumpsuit on in the store and loved it but decided to wait on purchasing it. after it went on sale i jumped on it because i new i would regret not buying it.   i am tall but most of my height is from my long legs, not in my torso. i seldom find jumpsuits that fit my frame but his one fits perfectly. the fabric is very "flowey" and does not wrinkle. the overall design of this jumpsuit is slightly but not overly baggy. the pattern and pleating make it a perfect item for spring and su
I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy, but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments, i can't see anything. in fact, that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required, so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds, 5'4", 34b, 28 waist, 40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it, but the salesperson suggested i try
Runs large in arm holes. have to wear bandeau. love this print and flow of dress. loose but still flattering due to arms and shoulders . love the overall look. midi length for this 5'6.5" gal. size s worked best -36c-125lbs
I love this dress. it is so soft and comfortable, perfect for summer!! i wish it came in more colors because i would buy everyone!!
This is the perfect bralette for comfort; it's soft and fits to form really quickly. i wear a b cup, and it's enough support for me to wear daily doing everything other than heavy exercise. now, at 5 months pregnant it's pretty much perfect to sleep in too. i'm at 35 band, and i'm still wearing it on the loosest closure, but it fits perfectly there for me.
This dress looks better in person. nice navy with subtle pattern - looks super cute with a really lightweat pale yellow sweater! i thought that wiastband area would hit in a funky spot (my problem area) but it doesnt and looks great. super comfortable and i love this neckline. also has a decent lining so no bra necessary if youre cool with that. i have packed on some "after 50" lbs and wear a 12-14 shirt and 10-12 pant and the large is roomy enough.i received a number of compliments and let's fa
I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.
Simply awesome. wonderful fit and flatters any body type. looks great booties, flats, or flip flops. must have ...
Although it may not look like it takes on a shape - what a wonderfully flattering jumper. was intrigued from seeing it in the catalog and had to try it on in the store -- i was unsure how the middle would appear. but it fit, wonderfully feminine, looking forward to the summer.
I loooove this. my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently. ran out of s p while in my basket (there are never enough petites available) so i got the medium. it is big but with this style i can pull it off. it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect. please make this in more colors/fabrics! i would buy them all!
This is such a pretty dress. light and flowy. i got it to wear on hot summer days.
I love these pants. i have them in navy and carbon. the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon. they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy. they loosen up as the day goes on as well. super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park. i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break.
Was so thrilled to receive my dress in the mail. its just what i was looking for, for my staple summer dress. i love how i can wear it with or without the sweater top, and even can pair just the sweater top with my high-waisted shorts!
I tried this on in the store in a regular medium and the size was fine, just the length. fortunately retailer will ship for free if you need a petite! i'm so excited to get this. i'm 5'1 and a bit busty, and the medium fit perfect. its very flattering and so comfortable! perfect for a hot summer day. or as the cute clerk in the store had it styled with a cropped jean jacket and a fun necklace. the styling idea's are endless. i'm waiting by the mailbox for it to arrive!
Perfect for the summer weddings that i am attending. i am 5-1, 119#, 32dd and usually a sp. i tried on a regular s and xs in the store, and the s was huge. i ended up ordering the regular xs instead of the petite xs when the 20% off sale hit because i liked the extra length. great bra coverage...it is not too long at the armholes, or too low in the back. i will take it up a bit in the top seams just so it doesn't have quite so much decolletage, but it is wearable as is. this is much more of a ro
A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large, so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly, looks adorable on, and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!
I'm very picky about jumpers, and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have, i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast, don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)
Nice flowing summer sun dress. i was looking for something very simple and put a colorful kimono over. it. i put a bando under it. i think this dress can be for all ages as my friend in her 20s bought and loves this dress as well.
This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.
I loved this dress from the moment i saw it! i ordered it immediately, after reading the reviews, and felt confident in my dress size choice...but when it arrived it was big! i am 5'7" 140lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, so usually a small but sometimes a medium...because if this "in between" that i am, i ordered a small...and it was really too big. so sad...incalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywhere. style is fun and flir
This dress is great. it appears just as it does online. its soft, flowy and a thin chambray material. the straps are adjustable which makes it a good fit for all women. i am fuller in my hips and toosh and this dress fell beautifully over them. i tried a large (i normally do l or xl in retailer dresses) and there was plenty of room! i would have probably liked the xl more just because i prefer things oversized. the dress is a midi length, very breezy and airy. its extremely comfortable and very fl
I was worried at first that the metal leaves would come off easily. i was pleasantly surprised after a day at disneyland, i don't think i lost even one of them. this dress is super fancy but very comfy.
These jeans have been the best pair of jeans i have ever worn. you could practically sleep in them, they are so comfortable, brushed softness, and stretch easily. they hug your body in a flattering way, that these jeans are worth the money spent, as you'll have them for a while.
I'd been eyeing this for months, loving the look but afraid it'd be too young for me (i'm 58). i tried it on in the store and loved it, with one caveat: it hangs rather like a sack, so i think it needs a belt for waist definition. with a belt, it looks great. my measurements are 38-30-38 and i wear a medium. oh, and contrary to what other reviewers have said, i don't find that the fabric is too thin or transparent.
Great fit. smooth, comfortable material. wrinkles, but nothing an iron can't fix. beautiful colors, i got both the teal and the black.
I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress, with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!  fit: i am 5'6" and curvy, usually a size 14/16, and the xl fits quite roomy on me (that's the size i ordered because i like flowy things). so it definitely runs large. usually i have better luck with a-line dress shap
I bought this dress for its green color and flowy design to wear at an irish fest held in the hot summer. it's perfect! being of irish descent with red hair and fair skin, i love all shades of green, and this green dress is no exception. the color is lovely and eye-catching and cool. as to the sizing, i usually wear a size 8, but to make sure due to the design, i ordered an 8 and a 6. there wasn't a great difference between the two dresses, but the size 6 top was a bit more fitted and looked bet
I just bought this at the store. i simply couldn't resist! it is very light and comfortable and could easily be dressed up or dressed down, sandals and a crossbody bag for exploring the city, strappy healed sandals and some flashy jewelry for a garden party or day event, slip on booties and a cardigan for the evening. can't wait to rock it. in terms of sizing, i am 5'5 150 with 36dd bust and some hips and booty. usually i am a size 6-8/m in dresses and pants but in true retailer style, i ended up
Great jumpsuit ! even better "in person"; elegant and stylish. i'am 5'7 and 165lb , m fits perfectly! material is not see- throug ( that was my biggest concern). sooo happy that i got it.
I purchased this in the mauve color. beautiful color with tan skin for the summer, but also perfect for fall. the material is very thin but not sheer at all. has quite a bit of drape/swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough. it fits me like it fits the model shown here. i am about 5'4" 115lbs and 32b and am keeping the small.
I originally ordered this in green, and unlike another reviewer, i thought the color was perfect for spring. it is trendy, flattering and fun in green, but perhaps not a color i would wear long-term, so i decided to return it and order it in red and black. i also noted the boxy cut, and if that is what you want, it runs true to size. however, if, like me, you want something a little more form fitting, consider ordering down a size or two (depending on your chest size,) and just carefully shimmy
I tried these on at my local retailer, and was like, no way am i spending almost $300 on a pair of jeans. alas, i could not stop thinking about them. the pictures really don't do them justice. they are a more substantial jean, have a distressed look, without being fragile. and yet they are so soft, so comfortable, you really just don't want to take them off. they do have a bit of stretch, but hold their shape all day long. the length and taper are perfect, in that you can wear them with boots, san
I love this dress, i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer. this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip, it is beautiful and is so comfy. it looks good with heels or sandals. i definately recommend this dress, it would look good on any body type.
This top is cute and could be worn to work or casually. being tall, i love how long this shirt is! definitely recommend!
I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!
I bought the blue pattern and really have found this print to be very fun and flattering and the tunic style great for work and play. highly recommend!!!
This is a beautiful sweater -- soft, lovely color and easy to wear. the current photo is more true to the length. i am 5'2" and 128 pounds and ordered the regular sm and it fits just below my hips.
Like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans. however, i purchased them at  20% off on retailer day and...honestly...they look so good i probably would have paid full price. these jeans are fresh!
After reading the reviews, i ordered this dress in an xs and sp. i'm 5' 3" and 120 lbs. the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest. the sp fits perfectly. i'm wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions.
I always look for things to hide "parts" without making my "parts" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn't notice. the length is perfect, the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top.
This shirt is easy, breezy, comfy, and stylish - everything i want as a busy mom. all the patterns are beautiful it i went with the blue motif as well as the floral print because they felt fun and easy to wear with jeans or white pants. this definitely fit a full size large for me. i tried my usual s plus xs thinking the shoulders might be too tight, but the xs was perfect. happy to have this beauty in the rotation!
This is my first pair of realllly expensive jeans, and they were worth every penny. i love the fit, the distressing, everything about them. they make me feel like i look amazing, which is what good jeans should do! i wear a 31 in pilcro jeans, but based on some reviews went up to a 32 in these and they are perfect. also, i'm 5'6 but the crop length hits at my ankle, which is perfect.
Shortened it to knee length and it was perfect. material is soft. comfortable to wear. can be paired with wedges or pumps or flats. fits true to size.
This shirt is just so easy breezy! i got the blue motif and love the pattern. the top is loose but it's supposed to fit that way. i have a feeling this will be my go to for the spring summer! i'm about 136lbs and ordered a small.
If there ever was the perfect feminine dress, this would be it .
I'm small (4'11, 98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting, is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put
I initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color, size l (my usual size, i'm 5'8" size 14). unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy, but loved the pattern and style. so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better. i'm very happy with my purchase.
I bought the dress in black. it is very elegant with a fun flare, suits my taste. it does run a size too small like other reviewer mentioned. the material has no give at all. i couldn't breathe in my regular size. one size up fits like a glove. it is a perfect party dress to show your free and fun spirit!
I agree with the previous comments. the vest runs a little large, so you can easily size down for a more form-fitting fit. it is so soft and the colors are lovely ... will be a welcome addition when the weather turns a little cooler. i am so glad i purchased this vest!
Fit great - maybe a bit large....i bought a l (typically i go between a large and extra large) and there is room to put a thick sweater on underneath it.  this goes with just about everything!
I just bought this top yesterday in the yellow. i can't wait until it warms up a little more to wear it. it's very comfortable and very cute. i did have to size down. i may get one of the other prints as well.
I ordered the yellow/floral version in size xl. it fits me just as shown with the model so it's true to size. it's very comfortable and made well. the floral looks the same in person as in the photos too.
I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!
Got the flower print and it is really a nice top. covers the butt!. i normally need a xl, but in this top i got a large.
I have received so many compliments on this top. it really looks exactly like it does on the model, and i'm not as thin as she is. i am 5'5" and 134 lbs,, small on top, and bought the small in this top. the v-neck is very flattering and is hangs so nicely that it does not make me look hippy. looks great from all views. i paired it with white pencil pants and wedge heels. also, the black lace detail down the sides looked great when i paired it with black yoga pants and flip flops. the colors are
Perfect party dress - well constructed, bra hidden at arms and on top, what more can you ask for? i felt like betty draper the moment i put it on. i'm normally a 6, but the 4 (while fitted) looked amazing and didn't pull.
I love this shirt! it hides my tummy perfectly without being too baggy! super cute!!
I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south, and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen, but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful, more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore, but i found them at my local store. just perfect.
I purchased this top in white. it is see through so i wear a tank or cami underneath. i usually wear xs or s in retailer tops and in this one, i purchased the xs, but wish i had bought a s. the problem is the top is just small enough to pull slightly between the top two buttons. for reference, i am 5'6, weigh 128 lbs, 34b bra size, 28 jean size, and small boned. i currently carry most of my weight in my hips and waist. my normal weight is 110-112 lbs and i add this to point out that i am out of sh
Picture definitely does not do this vest justice.  i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel.  i am 5'9" - 135 lbs - size 6 and the small works for me.  the vest will work with ivory, black, grey, and red underneath.  i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams.  the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look.  there are small pockets in the front as well.  definitely worth the 108$ asking price.
I purchased this in 2 colors. the black which is really actually a dark grey( no complaints) and the cream with black print version. i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime! looks great with skinny pants or jeans. great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan. does run on the looser side fyi
This is my favorite dress i have ever purchased. as a 6' tall woman, it's hard to find flattering dresses that are long enough for my legs. this dress is classic, comfortable, and truly flattering. i love the blush color and did not have the issues that other people listed for the color being see-through. i can't get enough of this style...i'll be buying it in black too...ooopss :)
Bought this top in white and blue motif. it fits me great and looks adorable. the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but it's an easy fix. this top looks great dressed up or down. would definitely recommend!
Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!
Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!
Love this top! i receive so many compliments wearing it, even from my teenage boys! runs large, but that's the style of it, very flowy. very flattering.
I'm so short that this could be a dress! runs a little big, but very forgiving. the green color is so vibrant! love love love!
This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it! i would recommend this product
Stopped in to my local retailer today specifically for this top. i was pleasantly surprised - the green is even more vibrant in person! just gorgeous. typically a size small but based on reviews tried on the extra small. still a tad roomy but portland doesn't carry petite sizing aaaaandidon'twanttopayforshipping... remedy that, retailer portland!
This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size, great color. lot's of compliments.
Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies.  retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it.
This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests, i just had to have this one. i've always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i'm curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact, the vest almost appears pink online, and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore
I love swing tops. the more swingy, the better! this top is so fun. its a little hard to tell online, but its made of two fabrics. most of the fabric is a thin t-shirt material, and then theres a panel on one side thats more of a silky fabric. its so so cool! the colors are just as they appear online, and the print is fun and edgy. i have larger arms, so i love the length of the sleeves. the other reviewer said it was cropped, but i did not have that experience. in fact i was able to wear mine w
I really wanted to love this dress. two lovely associates paired it with the desideria bib necklace and the black dakota cardigan, which gives the outfit definition and elegance. but the dress by itself would have needed altering to fit my 34-b top. i chose size m because of the length-- the small was 1 1/2 " shorter in front (i am 5'8") in the end, i realized i would probably choose my other favorites from my closet. but it will be stunning on the right person.
I love this dress - originally ordered the medium, which is my normal size, especially because i am tall. the arm holes were gaping, and so i returned for the small. the small is perfect. it fits exactly as on the model, and i didn't have a problem with the color being see-through. it really is so unique but so simple. the color is perfect.   i took a single star off because it is not lined - for the price, this would have been nice.
I've been on the hunt for the perfect dress to wear for my daughter's first birthday party. since we are throwing a traditional korean first birthday, i was looking for a dress you might wear to a daytime wedding or a fancy brunch. i just purchased this dress today in the store and it fits my needs perfectly.   i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer. this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it. it does drape nicely
This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!
I usually wear a size 28 & the fit was perfect. highly recommend, many compliments.
I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it in store. i tried it on immediately and knew i had to have it. it fits a little big -- definitely size down. but other than that, i have never felt more beautiful than when i wear this. the color is a perfect blush pink and the drop waist/tiered skirt make you feel downright bridal when wearing it, despite it being the perfect fabric for day. i find that this dress is perfect for those days at work when i have an event later.. it can be dre
This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!
I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. size down because it run very large, but it is nice and flowy. i'm 5'11" and slim and the top hung nicely on me.
This is a very flattering / soft sweater. the pockets make it so much cuter & do not make me look "thick". highly recommend!
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and ordered it immediately. i was a bit disappointed that the dress is a little lighter than the pink showed in the catalog but it didn't deter my liking it because it's still a lovely shade of pink. the fabric takes a bit getting used to though - i thought it would be silkier but it's really a thicker fabric. i ordered a size small and i usually wear size 4. the dress drowned me. so i returned it for an xs, which fit me beautifully. so
This is such an adorable tee. the stripes and lace up details are super cute and on trend. i usually take a xxs and that is what i took in this tee. i tried the xs and at 5"1 and 104 pounds it looked a bit loose and long on me. love this tee and highly recommend this one!
This shirt runs large, so order down a size. it is comfortable, cute and great for transitioning from summer into fall. adding jewelry really dresses this top up. can't wait to layer it with kimono, vest, pashminas or wraps. great with sandals or boots. glad i bought both colors. it looks much better on, than in the photo/on hanger. great purchase and can't wait to wear!
I purchased this poncho online in the cream color. when it arrived i tried it on to decide whether or not to keep it. i immediately went on line and purchased the taupe color , as well. thank goodness it didn't come in 5 more colors! this sweater is so versatile and beautifully detailed, plus it is very soft. you take one look at it and you know the quality! i think you could wear this dressed up or down and it would be perfect either way. i do agree, it is not quite as long as pictured , but pe
The green is a deep, beautiful shade. the fabric and fir is very flattering!
Love this white shirt! it fits great and gives you a little breathing room around the waist. this goes with shorts, skirts, and jeans. i will be wearing it all summer
Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining, but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5", 135lbs, 34c, muscular/curvy frame and a size 4 fit perfectly.
Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe.  love the grey color and the material is super soft.  glad i snagged this up for less than $30!
Great top!! love the fit, it pairs great with dark denim and pearls!! i ordered a 00 and am a 32c cup and 24-25 waist
This sweater is a perfect transition piece!  the material is really soft. while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesn't make you look like a big blob.
I am obsessed with this top. it is even more gorgeous in person.... a real showstopper!
Beautiful color and a great lightweight piece for fall layering. the petite sizing was perfect for me. more like a belted kimono. very happy with this purchase
This a lovely piece. you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details. i typically wear xxsp or xsp, so i did not expect this to fit, but decided to try it because i liked the style. as a petite, many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents. not this one. the xxs fit nicely - just the right length and width. i am 5'1" and 108 lbs. i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos, and not when you search for sweaters. it
Absolutely love this top. it is beautiful, well made and so unique.
The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.
I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it, so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale! it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top. i get compliments whenever i wear it- think hd in paris might be my new go-to!
This is probably a blouse for curvy women. with that i mean large breasted. i am a 40d and the xl fits well and the cleavage is in the limit of ok for the office. the bottom is a little too large but not too long. however, the fabric feels extremely comfortable and it stretches but it doesn't lose the shape. i am tempted to buy 2 more. if you are thin, you probably need to size down.
This tee is super soft and thin. perfect for hot humid days. i went with the neutral version and it is adorable with chino shorts or jean shorts. i found it ran big.. i purchased in xs and still pretty baggy.
These leggings are wonderful. they are incredibly soft, and stay in place when working out.
I initially tried this on in store and fell in love with the beautiful cut out details and fit. the star design is really cute and unique and the blue color is not see-through at all. i eventually had to buy the blouse online because i could not stop thinking about it. also machine washable is a major plus.
This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice, as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length.
I found this dress at my local retailer must be a web order return i feel in love with it once i put it on its better in person that online but it does run a little tight in the chest area  it was fine for me as i'm not big busted
I tried these on in-store not intending to buy them (was trying on shirts and needed to see how they would look with jeans!) and loved them! great "medium blue" color and they fit me so nicely (i am 5'2" with actual hips and thighs :) ...the price is a bit high for me though. hoping to find a pair at some point when they are on sale!
Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.
Beautiful and very feminine look but run big. i m 5ft 105 lbs curvy , size 00 fit me well
I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too.
Ordered this dress for a summer wedding. it is so cute! true to size, well made with a hint of tulle. super comfortable for moving and dancing. winner!
Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.
I purchased the yellow and i am quite happy. it matches a lot of things that i already own. nice summer tee.
I bought the "here comes the sun" version of this shirt. i had to have it. i'm a cervical cancer survivor who is still dealing with some health issues. i recently attended a cancer survivor event where a women talked about her life with cancer. she said that you no longer counts the years of her life, instead she counts her sunny days. i was inspired to do the same. so, i love this shirt. i got it on sale, but it still could've been cheaper.
Love this tee! lightweight, airy and comfy. i think it fits true to size. so soft and summery. can't wait to wear it this summer!
This is much more a blouse than a "tee". the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff, starched cotton, not stretchy jersey. because of that i felt like this top ran small. i had to size up.
I tried this on today and i wish i had taken it home. for me it was true to size, and the star print was perfect. flowy but not in maternity way at all. i'm gonna have to go back for this one!
Love the diving beauty version, it is charming without being too "cutsie" which i stay away from. the epitome of summer and that grab and go easy little statement. i find it runs true to size...you could safely size down if need be. love it! thinking of getting the here comes the sun too! tuck it in, tie it in the back or side or great just draping...love the little touch on the sleeve too...nice surprise!
This is great. on the model it looks largish, but on me it doesn't. if you're curvier like me (5'10", 155, 32e) it may be more fitted. long arms with great wrists. design is just as shown. not a sturdy piece. but not cheap looking in any way. i plan to hand-wash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time. just what i want to wear on certain days, and more colors would be great. thanks, retailer.
Comfortable material, fits true to size, love the color and can wear all year round. selected this dress for a fall wedding and its a keeper!
I stumbled across this dress at the store and fell in love. it's so bright and cheery but still sophisticated enough for most events. i love that the tulle that gives the skirt a slight flare and body is completely concealed. the dress is well lined and darling. i am small chested so i didn't have an issue with it feeling revealing nor did the lining hang out. i purchased this for my rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for my summer wedding. i look forward to wearing the dress many times after.
I"m not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringe-it spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heel-its perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right.
Fantastic signature retailer styling with this unique statement sweater. the pattern placement has a slimming look on the front and a rear enhancing look from behind. i've been using the super soft removable fur collar as a scarf and stole for my other outfits as well. the length is almost tunic on me, so it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans while buttoned up. if you choose to remove the fur collar the v-neck is very open, so i keep it unbuttoned when i style it that way. knit fabric is s
I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect! the details on it are amazing-delicate and lovely! i am 5'11'' and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes!
I bought the design which has now sold out, of the sailboats and waves along the top. the t-shirt is super soft and thin. but, it's not sheer or see-through. very light and cool for hot humid summer days. has some nice stretch as well. a really gentle cotton knit.  this top does run large. maybe that's so it will be cool and not stick to you? thus, i didn't size down because i don't like clothes too form-fitting on super hot days.
I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue, it's fun, it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite), but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great, and i know i will wear it a lot this summer.
Great fit, perfect length! so happy with these jeans. the fabric is pretty stretchy but definitely still has a denim feel. very soft - love these jeans!
I bought this top at my local retailer in a burgundy color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i want to get it in the other color they had in the store and also this black one available on-line. i bought it in a size 6 and i am 5' 2" , 34d. i sometimes get tops in petite but i felt the reg size fit just fine.
I purchased this item as a gift for my wife and she loves it. the quality for the price is great. soft and comfortable. needs to be washed with care but is worth it
Many compliments - great color and so comfy. most of my dresses from retailer are maeve brand, and i have never been disappointed.
Tts and very very sleek and flattering. just love for summer. nice light weight. feel great on and not saggy. nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue.
I really love this this dress, but i agree with the previous reviewer about the belt around the waist-it is a draped piece of fabric that is very figure flattering where it wraps, but one side of the dress has no belt and it shows muffin tops/bulges.i would have loved this if the belt went all the way around. one other point i would like to make is that bra straps are hard to conceal. i bought this dress because of the gorgeous color, but ended up returning it because of the belt and bra strap i
This is by far the most comfortable bra i've ever owned. i love the convertible strap feature. it's great for shirts with a back cutout.
I bought this tank in the blue popsicle print, and i think it's cuter in person than it is online. the beautiful pastel colors on the popsicles really stand out and make it special. i am normally a size 4-6, and the small fits me perfectly. also, i appreciate that it's lined. i wore it with skinnies, and received lots of compliments. it's the perfect tank for summer!
This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5'2"). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!
This is just a fantastic dress! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove. i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps :) i took the regular length and found it perfect. the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower. i'm only 5"1, but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me definitely a keeper!
This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile. great for dressing up or down. i am large busted (36g) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover. i am petite 5"1 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great!
This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4" 120lbs, about a size 4 in dresses, 32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height, it's just a few inches above my ankle, so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length, and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal, there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra, and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric
This dress is super comfortable and the material is so soft. the fit is very flattering and will cover any imperfections if you are heavier and want to hide anything. its more fitted in the top and drapes on the body very nicely. the hem is asymmetrical and the highest part of the hem hits about 2 inches above my knee and i am 5'3.'' i will wear this with tights for work. color is very nice also.
I love this dress!!! it's comfortable, flattering and stylish. looks great with flats or boots - awesome with a chunky scarf and tights.
I ordered a regular size xs and the length is still fine for me at 5'2". i love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfortable. i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer and the sale price is a great bargain!
I am so glad i tried this dress on. it is so chic and beautiful! perfect for an evening out or during the day. i can't believe the price!
I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.
Love! highly recommend...usually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge. so flattering!
This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out.
This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall. i'm 5'7" and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee. i could see it being very flattering on many body types. i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side. i bought the plum/brown color and am very happy with it.
Perfection! i am 5'3"/108 and the size 25 fit me like a glove. beautiful color too!! highly recommend!!
Thrilled that this not only fits great on me but i got it at a deep sale price!  all the problems that the negative reviewers had did not apply to me at all.  i'm so glad i gave this a try.  my body is large on top with a square waist, a bit of a tummy, no hips or bum and the medium petite skimmed over all my flaws and made me look more proportionate.  not sure why this is called halter though.  i am 5'3" 36dd, wide torso, size 28 jeans, 140#.
So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5"6" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition.
This dress is beautiful. it is longer than it looks on the model (i'm 5/5) but drapes beautifully. it is perfect for a wedding or a special event. i love it!
This dress is super soft and really flattering. i'm 5'2" and i tried a regular size m in the store and hated it on me, but decided to order a petite m and give it a try and i love it. it's one i've been wearing a lot with ankle boots and all sorts of jackets. it's great for these fall days that are still warm-ish. would be really cute with tights.
Love the sweater. the knit has a rich look and the fit is perfect. i paired it with a printed pencil skirt for an eclectic look. strongly recommend to your wardrobe.
Hi ladies, does this bra take a contortionist to put it on the first time? yes. did my boyfriend laugh at me hysterically while i tried to get it over the girls? yes. however, i am a large chested girl 34d, i bought the large and this is honestly the absolute best, most comfortable, amazing, non hurting/poking best strapless bra i have ever owned. i just bought three more, just in case the first two wear out. i love this, i love how far it comes down on the sides, i love that it doesn't slip do
I just got this in the mail & had to immediately write a review. i love it!. i took a risk & ordered the xxs, which i assume is a 00. it fits me perfectly so i would say it runs large. i'm a true dress size 2 but usually wear a 0 or xs in us sizing. the shoulder length from seam to seam is about 14 inches. i'm 32c-24-34. hope this helps!
This shirt feels so nice, it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile.
Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray, but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape.
Love this top! i bought it last month in the olive green color and love it. great quality fabric, comfortable and can be dressed up or down.
I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.
While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!
Slighty fitted, flattering, very soft and not itchy. the orange is a very nice color.
This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.
I got these on sale a few months ago. they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever owned. i'm 5'4 and they are the perfect length for me but i like my jeans a little long.
I had this dress in my basket for a long tiem waiting for free shipping. i liekd how it looked on the model. read the reviews, and wasn't sure, so waited... then my usual size sold out, so i decided ot try the smaller size (in petites, otherwsie i would have gotten it in the store :_)) i needed pettie and the smaller size is perfect! the color says black, but it looks more mifnight (aka blue), my friend even said (when i tried it on), you know i laways love anything blue... so don't expect dark
Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.
Love this design it puts a twist on a turtle neck sweater. the only problem i had is that the tie kept coming undone but if you do a double knot the problem is solved! wish i would have bought all the other colors.
I tried these in store, didn't have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me (small waist and athletic, fuller legs). but surprisingly these work great. they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend. i do think they run a little small. i am almost always a 2/26, but i took these in a 4. they didn't have a 2 in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight. highly recommend!
Love these pants!!! retailer - please sell more colors and patterns of these! i have a hard time finding work pants that fit right, don't have to be hemmed (i'm 5'3") and aren't boring. this is just enough pattern to be interesting, but still neutral enough to pair with other things. i bought them full price and would happily do so again for another pattern!
This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it's fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!
I wish i hadn't waited so long to buy this! the smalls were sold out in grey by the time i finially did, but the medium ended up being totally fine. perfect for a warmer winter, it is pretty thin so i wouldn't trust it on it's own to keep you warm in cold weather, but easily could be layered! i love the fun aspect of the tie front for this sweater as the front tuck is becoming a little tired in my eyes. i love that you can make it shorter or longer or even tuck it in because the ties aren't sewn
Love this sweater. i have it in cream and ordering navy. it is comfortable and looks great with pants or a skirt. i do not like my sweaters tight so i have a large and love the fit. i am 5' 4'' and weigh 135 and usually buy medium to large.
I love this! seriously would buy again. i wish it was warmer out so i could wear it
I have a small collection of retailer pants for work, and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun, patterned pair. i am short (5'2") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality, smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch, and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid
I love these pants so much i even paid full price for them.  i'm going to order them in navy too.  super cute fit.  cute with flats or heels.
I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod
Gorgeous colors on lovely silk skirt. longer on me than in photo, but i'm only 5'4". i usually wear a size 12 or 32" waist jeans, but i could not zip up the large. by several inches. i'm not sure if i can possibly cover the waist and still wear it that way. sad because i've had my eye on this for months:(
Absolutely beautiful -  usually don't leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn't. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it's very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, i'm apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs.
Very cute! waist is a little big for me but overall a pretty good fit.
Tried this on and loved it! chic, lightweight, warm, cute left as is and cuter belted. ended up letting a friend buy it since it was the last one but will be adding to my iso list for sure!
I love this shirt! i was surprised by the other reviews. it's boxy, but not unflattering. i get so many compliments on this. a steal for the price.
It's rare to find such a great skirt -- flattering, unique design, substantial (denim-like) fabric, something with pockets! this skirt has everything, including an adjustable buckled waist. i love the slight a-line shape, too. for me it fits true to size (the same size i wear in skirts from other brands). i love the colors -- ivory background, cobalt, periwinkle, orange, blush pink, yellow, black. it will be easy to pair with tees or button-down shirts and cute sandals.
This skirt fits my curves so well. the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit. it sits high on me, but i have a very long torso so that didn't bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs. the colors are vibrant and versatile.
Ordered this top online, color is a little more gray than green but it is gorgeous, comfortable and flattering, so much so, i am ordering the navy too. great quality , fabulous with jeans .
I love this blouse! the colors of the little sunglasses are vibrant against the black background, the buttons on the front are also a coral/peach color and beautifully made. its thin enough to be worn in the summer or fall without making you sweat or freeze. i ordered a medium, which i usually wear in most retailer tops and it fits perfectly. i'm a 36b and can run from an 8 to a 10 in tops. i do recommend trying it on before purchasing if you can, especially for women with a larger bust. th
Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person. the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos. the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections (but not too heavy...) length as shown on model.
This top can be dressed up or down, very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo (blue). i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in. i think it might be too short otherwise.
Love the color (cedar). love the style. sleeves are long and wide but that is the style. biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped. the length given in the product info is very short. but when i received my normal size (l) the sweater comes to my hips. just right. the fibers are man-made (acrylic) so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy. the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath. when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s
Love everything about it!! chunky, comfortable, lazy day or dress up with a cool necklace!
Love, love this clever eyeglass print. i bought the black background with bright sunglass print - perfect for pairing with jeans, shorts or a slender skirt.
Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.
Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day.
I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!
The quality of this vest is outstanding, and the warmth is exceptional. i have worn it as a jacket on milder days, in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe. it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted. it runs large by style, but i am 5'1", 100 lbs and i can carry it off.
I love this skirt! it's a denim material, so it's structured, but not too heavy for warm weather. the colors are bright. it may run a bit big, but i didn't have trouble with my usual size. the pockets are actually usable. great for casual and easy to dress up.
Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.
This jacket is my favorite purchase in a while! i used my last month 50th birthday discount on it! it is of exceptional materials and quality construction. the juxtaposition of the stripes against the beautifully vibrant embroidery on back is stunning! it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! my size medium came in the european size 38. for reference, i am an american size 8-10.  it is comfortable to wear and can easily accomodate large ful
I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!
I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on. the vest fits so well, and the thick fabric feels amazing. love the pockets! like the previous reviewer, i feel like i'll be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit. it has an ever so slight racer back, so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders, but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it. the draping in the front also falls really nicely. great bu
With my 5'9', hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts: _________ pros: - lots of stretch and comfort. - pockets! always a plus in my book :) - will go with any top. - nice length. fit me as in the model. - very slimming. - you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi
This is a favulous cape...in fact i would buy another if there were other colors! it is oversized, playful, chic, dramatic and simply put a true statement piece. it will not be flattering to your figure...it is not suppose to...but it will show your true sense of style! wish it had pockets...i may add them for more play.
These two blouses are probably my best purchases anywhere in some time. fit is perfect, quality is great and both will be worn many times this summer and into the fall. unique from the all other tops i have seen lately.
This skirt is really cute and versatile, it can be dressed up or down. i paired it with a black chiffon top for a dressed up look and a denim button down for a casual look. the length is good, and the buckles allow it to be tightened, which is a plus if you have an athletic body.
I saw the skirt on a display today at my local store. i was attracted by the colors and the display itself. my thoughts, " give it a chance". i bought the size 10 without even trying it on, with the idea that the colors and style had so much potential, i am so pleased with this skirt! the fit is true, although if you like a higher ride on the waist, i would size down. the fabric has just the right amount of stretch to make it super comfortable. i had so many staple items in my wardrobe that i wi
This shirt is exactly what i expected! it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great! it's the perfect shirt for summer, loose fitting but in a flattering way. the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colors!  i highly recommend it!
I saw the black in store and had to try on. it is very, very cute. i would say it fits a bit small. i tried my usual medium and while it fit, it was a little short. id take you could take your regular size or size up. i would not size down in this one. adding to my wish list and hoping it sticks around til sale time!
Let it be known that i hate shopping for jeans. i recently had my go-to skinny jeans rip by my back pocket and new i needed to get something new & better stat. i have a pair of black ag sateens that i got a few years ago, and i decided to try out this pair. i got them in the mail yesterday, and i never want to part with them! they are perfection. they hit perfectly on my waist; they're incredibly comfortable and basically make you feel like you're wearing the jean equivalent to yoga pants. they
Was scared at first to order this product, when i tried it on i was amazed on how good it looks. fits just like the model picture, and the material is awesome.
Great dress! wish it came it more colors, would like to buy another one. i am 5'5",125, size small is perfect. unlike one of the previous reviewers, i do not think it is too clingy. maybe she needed to size up.very versital, cute with a jean jacket, or long lightweight scarf, booties, or sandals! .
This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5".
This is such a unique and fun dress. i'm so glad i found it and it fits perfectly!
I've passed this dress by a number of times online, but ordered it on a whim on the mothers day promo. based on the reviews, i ordered my regular size, medium. it fit perfectly. i do think the cut is on the trim side, but it isn't tight or fitted. i probably couldn't eat a big meal in this though as it would probably show in this dress. the fabric is buttery soft! the button placket down the front is very clean and lays flat. there are two side pleats that are a different fabric and are ever so
What a unique twist on the traditional cargo jacket! the swing styling on this jacket is so cute---not too full-, you still get a nice silhouette from the front, with the swing in the back this is a fresh take on this staple. it will be a "go-to" piece in my closet!! the quality of the material and tailoring on the jacket is wonderful!!! as other reviewers have commented, it does run large. i am exchanging it for a size down. i can't wait to get it in and wear it!
You make classy stuff. this skirt is a nice take on a tweed skirt. colors: can't tell from the picture, but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed, very fun and happy, yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering, the scallop part is interesting though, it is sown at one part of the skirt, in the middle, not sure why. i ordered the 0p, and that fit me like a glove. (26.5 in waist, 35-36 in hips, 115 lbs).  length on the petite was above the knee, like show
I tried these on at the store and thought the color, texture and style was very nice, but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle, so i suppose it is still do-able, but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it.
Love the blue color. is a bit short, but fine with a tank underneath. i purchased the small, that's what i usually wear.
This jacket is perfect! the crop length is just right! not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame. i'm a a 12 typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust 36dd. this jacket is loose fitting and roomy. i could probably have gone with a large, but i'm really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and it's just super roomy and comfy. the quality of this jacket is great. it will be a staple for years to come. i
I love this top. i got a medium in black on sale. i am 5'8'' and 135lbs. the medium fits great. the medium is slightly loose on me through the tummy, which is nice - in my experience, it is not too constraining, contrary to other reviews. however, i think it depends on your body shape; i am a coke-bottle. this will be a wardrobe staple for day to day and going out; note, it is too low-cut for work wear. very happy with my purchase.
These are some of my favorite new pants. i am never disappointed by the quality from this brand and they are super comfortable and adorable. a definite must have!
I'm surprised by the negative reviews and i'm here to come to its defense! i love this dress! i'm solidly a 0 petite in tracy reese and this fit perfectly. the top isn't snug but it's not roomy enough to say it runs large. just perfectly comfortable. the belt was a little tricky because it has to thread through several loops, but it stays put nicely and fit perfectly without being too snug or uncomfortable. the fitted top with the belt offsets the fit and flare style of the skirt. lace is beauti
Received december 23 and 83 degrees in louisiana but weather can change from hot to cold in an hour. this sweater is so soft, so cozy, i'm ready to run the air conditioning! beautiful styling, well-made, and has a generous fit that you may or may not prefer. this will be one of my very favorite garments . luxurious, and i deserve it. i ordered a large, have long arms, and the sleeves do come over hand as shown in photo. it is very loose and flows over my jeans. i am an extremely difficult to ple
Absolutely love, love this dress. it is so comfortable and falls perfectly. the material is great and you can dress it up or wear it casually. if it had more colors, i would get it it in any color it came in!!
I bought this dress with my birthday gift and i do not regret it! it's so soft and feels like pure comfort but the details, little metal buttons down the front, the vent pleats on the side; make it feel special. i received many compliments and i would urge you to get this one if you are seeking comfort. it was pretty true to size and because i'm an average height i wore a small block heel with it.
After reading the reviews about this top being really clingy, i decided to order up a size and purchased a medium. when i took it out of the box today and held it up it looked huge and i thought i had made a mistake. however when i tried it on it actually fit really well! i could see if i had ordered my usual small how it would have clinged to my body in a unflattering way. very happy with the top and thankful for the reviews.
Great pair of pants to wear to work, and interview or out to lunch. i got so many compliments the first time i wore these. i'm 5'2" i ordered the burgundy color in a size 0, regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine. however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that they're a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed!
This dress did not impress me when i was browsing the website online. when i went to a store, though, the colors struck me as really vibrant and earthy, and i wanted to give it a chance. i tried it on and it fit like a glow! i am a 5'1'', 100 pounds, and got an xxs p which was a perfect fit. the length was great for me (petite size) and did not need altering. the online photo may not do justice to the little details on this dress. definitely a very high quality dress that i would categorize as a
Love this top. very easy to wear to lunch or site seeing. the fabric is soft and drapes nicely.
I wanted this top ever since i saw it online, it is so me. it's a nice mix of feminine and masculine, you can pair it with a nice pair of jeans or even business pants to dress it up. this will make the perfect summer shirt and it hangs so nicely! i highly recommend this shirt, i would get it before its gone!
I love sundry clothing. this lightweight fleece is the perfect weight. it keeps you warm enough when it's cold, but not hot when it is milder. it's super soft with nice embroidery. size 1 is a great fit for my 5'1" frame. wear it to hang at home or to go out.
Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.
If you care that it's sheer- be forewarned. i probably won't wear a cami under it, as it's not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it's cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size.
So comfortable, great fit, dress it up with wedges, down with flats, extremely soft and flattering. i normally wear a xs/s and the small fit perfectly. i'm 5'6" and the length is just slightly cropped.
I just purchased these pants in red on sale. i am 5/5", 143 pounds, and the 10 fit perfectly (i am either an 8 or a 10 in pants, depending upon brand). it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute, unique, work-appropriate, and flattering. these pants fit the bill in all aspects. i thought i would prefer the black, but am really glad i got the red.
Great dress, fit perfectly warm for the winter, i live in florida it will be great if we get a winter next year. very comfortable and easy to wear.
Being somewhat on the 'fluffy' side, the style is very flattering and forgiving and will be ideal for summer. i am between a size 14 and a 16 and the 14 fits perfectly. light and airy a very nice, simple embroidery in contrasting color. very chic in an effortless way. the armholes are just right--not too big! the color is definitely a creamy ivory. worth the cost because i don't think it will be available for too long.
I loved the jumpsuit but unfortunately had to return it due to running a little on the small size.
I love these pants! beautiful quality material, soft on the skin. fits well. definitely a tailored fit. true to size. unique design, and really fun! i am 5 foot 5, and weigh 132 lbs. i am apple shaped, so i was worried these would be too tight around the hips, but they aren't .
I love this romper!  i am 5'2 and the medium fit great and wasn't long.  i'm short so i thought i would have to hem this!  it's comfortable and, although, i'm not a huge fan of gauze, the fit was perfect.  i had to snatch it!
However, i unfortunately followed others advice saying these run small. i had to return/ exchange to a 00p. in turn had to give up the sassy red and settle for black. although they are beautiful trousers in black as well...
Received this shirt yesterday and loved it. doesn't look that great online in pics, but it is a unique and beautiful top. the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape . i am 5'5 and 128lbs and a small bust size 34a , i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didn't want it to tight around my butt.... i am curvy in that area size 6 pants....i ordered the medium and i am so glad i did .. it lifts just like on the model...the only downfall
This dress is absolutely amazing! i am an retailer addict, a good portion of my wardrobe is from retailer. that being said, this is one of my all time favorite purchases! this dress is a beautiful statement. i am tall and curvy and this dress fits like a glove but is very comfortable. the quality of the beading and the fabric is very good. i wore it on my hawaii vacation, and got numerous compliments! don't pass this one up! five stars!
These pants are fantastic! the pattern alone is to die for, but they also have just the right amount of stretch for the perfect fit! i received so many compliments when i wore them i felt like a rock star!
Bought these in 2p and i'm normally 0p in most pants. for reference, i'm 5'1 and 107 lbs and the 2 fit perfect! got many compliments on these pants
This jumpsuit is great. i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last 10 lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable. i'm usually a medium & i wasn't sure if i should size up. i ordered the medium and it was the right choice. great light material for summer and nice neckline.
I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.
This dress is absolutely beautiful! it fits like a glove and the material is super soft. so in love with this! i'm 5'2'm and normally a xs/s. the xspwas a better fit in the waist and chest. the arm holes were a bit tighter on me. the sp was way too large.
I tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love! i'm a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips. this dress made me look and feel slimmer, and is light to wear. the dress is a perfect length too. i'm 5'11 and this dress hits me right at the ankles. if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual, this one is perfect!
I decided to try this on just for fun because the colors and design are absolutely gorgeous. here are my thoughts: _________________ pros: - the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart. - pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :) - the length is ideal for taller folk. - it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if you're tall as i am, this won't be an issue. - nicely conservative at the top.  cons: - i
Beautiful colors
This is one of my favorite tops i've ordered. flowing and relaxed with great details at the neck. i get compliments every time i wear it.
This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!
I was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint! the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant. the design is unique and provides visual appeal, and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place. i love the high waist on these!
This skirt is a nice medium weight and is lined. my normal size 4 fit perfect. i only wish it was available in petites. if you are petite, the skirt is ankle length. but this is a good skirt to wear to work.
These trousers are wonderful. the fabric is comfortable and does have a little give to it.
I really wanted to not like the top for that price, but ti looks really good, the beading makes the shirt stunning... i ordered the 0p, not sure what size to get, and it is just fine. the length is almost too short, but isn't. the rest of the shirt fits nicely. the shoulder are wide, like poofing out a bit, perhaps that is hwy some people thought it looked large? the beading work is beautiful also a little sheer, but not crazy. debating whether to keep it but right now i love it. also, teh colla
Very pretty top, comfortable and soft but looks nice enough for work!
Normally i am a size 10 or 12 but i sized down to a small. still very swingy and beautiful. i bought the pink and the taupe as well. the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains!
I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality
I got this top in an xs and the fit is great. the top is a little darker than pictured. it looks great with white, kaki and denim.
I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this top! at 5' 6", i'm rather busty, short waisted, and full-figured. i ordered my usual size 16, and the fit is a flattering, 'almost' empire silhouette. i was worried about the back being too long for my body shape, but it works great. the embroidery and construction make this a really special piece.
This skirt is a rare find. slimming, flowing, and best of all, it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips, while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial, yet soft, so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose, better in person that the picture here, and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to
Fabric is soft, body runs a bit big but falls nicely. length is great for leggings or skinny jeans. overall, wonderful tee shirt!
The skirt is a little longer than i expected, it hits me at my calf, i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so i'm going to wear it as it. the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely, very feminine. nice skirt for a picnic
I tried these on in the store and didn't buy them with the other items in my 'yes' pile. i couldn't stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them. they are so cute. the fabric is a nice weight. they have little stretch.
I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a spring/summer item, but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders.
It's hard to go wrong with the charlie's, especially in this fabric, keep them coming!! i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well. they fit pretty true to size, i'd say try both your usual size and one size down as well, they stretch out a little, so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind. because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric. try wearing a burnt orange, green, or pink (the isabella sinclair grid wrap but
Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you
Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.
This is a really great top. it looks fantastic on. while it is a bigger fit, its so flattering. i get tons of compliments every time i wear it.
I ordered this shirt last week, it's beautiful!!!!! it's even prettier than the photo. i'm 5.3 120lbs ,i ordered the petite 6 and it fit perfectly!!!! i wish it came in more colors, i'd order another one in a minute!
So i actually loved this skirt (the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together) and it's rare to find something that's simultaneously so form-fitting and comfortable.... but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs, and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work (especially with that long slit - i might feel differently if it didn't have that slit, because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office). if
I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it's stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip don't spill on it lol. my fault though so still 5 stars!
This top is everything i wanted it to be. the fabric is beautiful, and the fit is flowy and comfortable. i would love to own a u-neckline version.
I order this sweater in black - size small - and i just love it. i'm a slender 5' 9" 130 lbs and the small is perfect in for me. while it has the classic cardigan look and a slightly oversized "boyfriend" feel to it, the rounded front hem, hip pockets, and buttons that end slightly above the bottom hem (where the rounded hem begins) are unique touches i appreciate and love in retailer's clothing. the weight was slightly heavier than i expected and better quality, but it is perfect for my minneapol
Flattering fit and neckline. too thin to wear without a cami or tank underneath (for me), but i was expecting that. great go-to tee.
I've been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger. i'm glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe. they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts. these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights. they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl; they are really sweater tights. i think this aspect is great, but they do not have as much give as other tights. i am petite, about 5'3" 112 lbs and the small
I love this top. i am always looking for tops that are comfortable and work as basics. the material is super soft and not too clingy. it feels like pajamas, but looks very polished. i am a little wide in the stomach and bust, but this didn't look boxy. i got these in all 3 colors.
These tights are so cute and can add some fun to any outfit. i paired with a mustard mini, denim shirt and desert boots! they do run small. i am a size 4 and had to get the m/l
I love retailer sweaters, in fact, i believe all my sweaters are from retailer! this cardigan is really nice and i'm so glad i bought it. it will work well with skirts, dresses, pants... it's well made and soft and comfy. highly recommended!
This cardigan runs slightly large as it is boxy, which i love. the color is exactly as pictured and it is soooo soft! can't wait to wear it with a t-shirt and jeans!
I am short, on the heavy side. 5'1" 156 lbs. i always wear large petite. this beautiful blouse swallows me. lots of fabric on the front side of the shirt, causing a boxy look. i could totally do a mp if not sp. i am going to try and exchange.. beautiful blouse, great quality, breathable fabric. colors are deep and rich. so comfy.. highly recommend.
Adore the rust color in this top. very pretty rust color. would go with a lot of stuff. my only small pet peeve with the shirt is the opening under the hook and eye. i have been wearing a seamless tank underneath. but everything else about the blouse fits so perfect, drapes nicely that i think the opening is a minor thing that a tank top can fix. beautiful on. felt that it fit tts. i'm usually a 34b, got an xs in this top.
I like to have a capsule wardrobe for all seasons so that when i travel, or just for everyday, i have a multitude of options with a few good quality pieces. i am not a fan of 'dry clean only' items, so anything that i can find that i can at least hand wash with good results and is within my color palette and sense of style is always a great find. this light weight cardi can work for multiple seasons easily, it is a tad boxy, but it actually works for me (5'4, 34c, 125 lbs) i can wear it with a c
This is a cute work jacket, as well as paired with jeans.  flattering. very soft.  only con is this is thick with a soft cotton lining, so not great for summer in az, but will get plenty of use this fall. typically 6-8 on the top, i went with medium.  not tight in the arms as other reviewer noted.
This vest is perfect. it is a great layering piece to be worn with jeans, slacks or a skirt. it has a substantial weight without being restrictive. i made the purchase based on the other positive reviews and it was "love at first sight."
The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back, so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review, i am not thrilled about the hook and eye, but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants.
Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.
I love layering this over basic tees (or graphic ones like the wild west tee) - it adds just the right amount of edge. currently building my pin collection to add on (vintage turquoise and rock music to be exact).
Classic and stylish. trendy with the blocking...rich colors, soft and comfy. i typically wear s and s was perfect. i love this sweater.
I love this top!!! i just had a baby and it is difficult to balance classy with comfortable with out looking sloppy. this top is perfect. it may run a tiny bit big but for the most part it is true to size. great for busty girls (36dd).
The color of this top is a bit more vibrant than online. material is light, but i can wear a beige bra underneath and not need a cami. fit was true to size for me and detail at the neckline is flattering. a keeper for me!
I had to have this when i saw it in a store. i was drawn to the shape and the neutral colors. i wore it for the first time today with a black tank. on me it looks best unbuttoned. it looks good with pants. the small fit best although the arms are a little tight at the upper arms. i have muscles so i don't think i could wear it with any top with sleeves.
The color is as pictured, like a deep coral. very comfy and great drape.
These fox tights are so very cute and fun! how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over! they are warm too! these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them! they are a real attention getter!
I really like this vest. personally, i think it is difficult to find vests that fit properly. this is a good one. fabric and color good. the photo is very representative of the color. no surprises there. arm holes are not too big which is often a problem. the detail on the back gives it some added interest. the only thing i would mention that could be a negative is that it is short, especially in the back. again the picture is representative but do pay attention to the length and be certain that
I didn't pay much attn to this online. i'm not much on front hook & tie closures. well, saw today at the local store & decided to try on both the s & m. i am usually a s in tops, but the m was only a bit more roomy & longer than the s, so i went with the size m. i thought the styling of it paired well w/ the pilcro cord skinnys i had on. looked much better than the pics online. i have other pilcro skinny cords & jeans in vs colors so i think this top will work out well for me. love the 3/4 sleev
Fell in love with this a soon as i saw it in store. it is soft and can eaisly be dressed up or down. wore it to work already and got so many compliments.  unfortunately when i saw it in store they didn't have it in stock. the very helpful gentlemen at the irvine, ca location checked online but it was sold out in my size. so he checked the stores that carried it. i called one and the mailed it to me. customer service in store is great!
At first, i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it's lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it's hot! i'm 5'2'', 135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i didn't wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of
Perfect jean. these jeans are comfortable, the length is great, and the rise, at least for me, is spot on. my torso is fairly straight - not a lot of the hourglass thing going on - and somehow these jeans feel like they were made for me. thank you pilcro.
This is going to be my go to all season. looks great with a sweater dress and boots also looks great with cords!
I love this and instantly felt sexier when i put it on, yet with the longer sleeves and looseness felt i could wear it casually.   i will say that i have to often keep adjusting/pulling the top neckline down. it seems to want to revert to above-the-shoulders position.   the fabric and quality feels nice and it was a great purchase for me!
I just received my duster . i love it! the coat is as pictured. the fabric is medium weight denim with some stretch. it feels like a denim coat that you have worn for years. i'm 5'8" and the duster hits mid-calf. i'm a curvy size 14-16 and the xl fits perfectly. the only issue that might arise is that the sleeves are long; they fit me perfectly but i have long arms. this will be my new go to coat for fall.
A cute top. slightly tight in the upper area. debated returning but decided to keep as the top is unique and i know that i will wear it frequently. aleardy thinking of way to wear all year around! runs small
Unlike the other reviews, i love this skirt. the lining is a nice stretchy material, as is the eyelet overlay, making it a really easy to wear, and comfortable skirt while still looking polished and professional.    i bought it so that its slim fitting, more like a pencil skirt.  i've only worn it to work dressed up, with boots, but suspect i'll get a lot of use in the summer with flip flops and a tee shirt.  i highly recommend it, and think it's a great price.  it is longer than on the mode
I love panties. i love the prettiest, softest, most adore-worthy panties i can find. these are my favorite boy shorts--i can always put them on and feel pretty. no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch. im a mom and my body isn't perfect anymore, but these panties give me confidence, with perfect coverage. i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer. my only warning: wash these pretties as delicates, or the lovely lace colors will fade.
I'm glad i got this skirt because it's prettier in person than in the picture. fiance loves it so that's a bonus. it's tts although it's longer than shown on the picture. very high quality and looks expensive. i'm very happy with this purchase.
I was out of town when my coat arrived, and was so excited to get home and try it on!!  i haven't worn it yet, but we've now got the weather for it...and i can't wait!  i'm 5'7" and heavier than i'd like, but the xl fit perfectly!
Fits beautifully. perfect for spring and summer. the cut of this skirt gives your figure a wonderful shape. the quality of the material is excellent.  this item is perfect for to dress up for a date night or wear slightly more casually for a brunch.
I love this dress so much. the fabric on top is not something i would have chosen-it is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel. but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras. i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one. otherwise you would have to go with a strapless-and the right kind of strapless, with this dress.  when they say it flares it really does-and much more than i was expecting. the bottom part of the skirt f
Timeless skirt. just don't like the placement of the slit, so maybe i'll sew it up.
Nice color and cut but runs very big so size down. will need to send back due to on line only. i am hoping one size smaller does the trick.
When i first tried this top on, i didn't like it because the chest just spilled open. i saw it on someone else and it was so flattering i gave it another try. i bought it in both the red and the black, and plan to put a stitch or safety pin through the top to keep it closed. it is very slimming and hides tummy/muffin top issues. i plan to wear it with the stretchy knee length maeve pencil skirts all summer, along with shorts and pants. give this one a try!
This skirt is great to wear to work. nice medium weight. being cotton, it doesn't get to hot. skirt is lined. nice flattering shape. my normal size 4 fit perfect. love the godets. comfortable. doesn't get all wrinkled from sitting. nice royal blue color.
The dress was great! the zipper was just a little tough but over all a very classic, feminine piece.
Adorable dress. could hardly get the zipper up in my very typical size 4. i will order a 6 and am hoping it will work out!
Love love love this skirt. i walked into retailer in august not looking to buy this skirt even though i saw it in the catalog and thought it was cute. once i tried it on i fell in love. i purchased both black and blue. super flattering and true to size. its a must have for sure.
This skirt is everything i love about retailer. the fit, style and quality are amazing. i feel like a am wearing a piece of art. it is so unique and fits perfectly. way to go retailer!!
Gorgeous skirt. runs a bit big.  well made. perfect for the office and super comfy.
This is one of the best date night tops i've seen in a while. i'm 5'6, 120 lbs and the xs is perfect. the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice. i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed, but i do that often so i don't see it as a design flaw.
Despite being a knit, this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable.
Love this shirt, very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric, but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.
I bought this yesterday and love it. it drapes beautifully. it's a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semi-casual occasions. the first tier hits at the natural waist, while the second tier hits at about hip height. this is very flattering for the waist, while still being drape-y and a bit loose. i thought this fit a little bigger than to size. i am currently postpartum boobed so i am 5'4", 135 lbs and 34dd and the s fit great. (i am currently a s in other retailer tops).
I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.
Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this, and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit, as i have a large chest, and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8), and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on, and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5"2'), so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference, i'm about 5'9". hope this helps!
I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165, 36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer, so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top, without being cutesy. love tylho tops!
Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a
This top is adorable, especially the grey check. timeless staple, with a modern & cute update. i agree with 2nd reviewer; i don't think this blouse pulls or is tight in the chest. i'm also a 34d, i got a small, it fits perfectly & i wear it all the time - i think it's great for every season. very flattering, the peplum hits at just the right spot and defines the waist. i get compliments all the time. i pair it with cropped sweaters when it's cold. the grey does seem a bit higher quality; the blu
Buy this skit- it's everything that retailer used to be. great pice, work appopriate, and it fits great.
Wow im really glad i didn't listen to the negative reviews! in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops! the neck line i agree does need to be secured. i wish they would have added a snap. it's fine though as i don't mind sewing it closed. this top is worth it! i'm 5'2 108 lbs and small chested. so for slim girls i think this is perfect!
I found this skirt to run tts - i am a size 16 and the bought the xl. it is so soft and comfortable and the colors are so much prettier in person. i paired it with a black turtle neck and black dolce vita booties that i snagged on sale at my local retailer. happy girl!
This sweater is comfortable yet still work appropriate. the ruffled shoulders adds a feminine touch.
I love jeans!!! especially this pair. perfect fit, hugs in all the right places. perfect length! worn it 3x already! and it gets better every time you wear it. goes great with a cute too!
This dress is made of a very thick material both on the top and bottom, making it very flattering. lots of compliments!
I love this dress! perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves.
This skirt caught my eye immediately. i love the beautiful patterns and colors. i'm currently pairing it with a charcoal grey top, which works well. the only slight concern is the material is a little poofy. i still love it, and definitely recommend this standout piece.
I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!
Beautiful, flattering dress. love that you can where a bra without having to be concerned about straps showing. very happy with purchase. highly recommend.
These are the most comfortable pants i own. i bought them in the gold, green, and gray (which really does look more like a grayish purple). the gold is my favorite - it goes with so many things! i was just checking to see if there were any other colors - would love them in black and a burgundy. i'm about 125 lbs,, 5 foot 7, and the 28 is a perfect fit. the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out, but i haven't found that to be a real problem.
Love these pants! super comfortable, but feel high quality. i am usually a size 2 and the xs fits perfectly.
130 lb, 5'5, 32dd. ordered xs. this dress is a bit outside my normal retailer style, but i love tracy reese designs and it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try. i could not be more pleased with this decision. as some of the other reviewers have said, the dress is very well made. the lining in particular is excellent- it is a soft mesh that prevents the dress from clinging, without adding bulk in the hot summer weather. i typically wear more structured dresses, but the lining on this dres
As most other reviewers stated, the skirt does run a bit large and long. however, it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!
I love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online. it's pricey but i am holding on to it because it's really beautiful. i got a medium. i'm 5'2", medium built. it's just perfect. i'm tempted to get the petite but with petite, the top gets to be too short so i think i'll stick with regular size. my family loved it! the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous! you can easily dress this up or down.
I love this top! fits true to size. tunic length, thin comfy fabric, adorable subtle print. the perfect top!
This is my first ever review! these pants are 5-star fantastic. ordering additional colors because i love these so much and am finding i want to wear them every day. i initially ordered the bronze color which is superb, just beautiful. i was worried it might be too bright to wear to work, or be a different hue in real life, but they look just like the picture. to my happy surprise they dress up easily. it's a really rich color that i have been able to pull off at work with long sweaters and boot
I feel like an indian goddess in this dress! lots of swing to it!
This romper originally caught my eye in the beginning of the summer with the sweet back bow detail. i had originally planned to purchase for a trip to paris in june, but waited until the last minute and my size wasn't immediately available at my local store. i had honestly forgotten about the romper until i noticed it recently in the sale section ... at that price i couldn't pass it up. again it wasn't available in my size at the store location, but they were able to ship it w/in a few days. i p
Love the unique details and neutral color scheme. top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my 5'2" 115 lb. frame. it's comfortable and well made. thicker material.  seems to be holding up fine after one washing.  looks great with skinny jeans.  highly recommend!
The little details are just beautiful. the embroidery and tassels are so cute. loose fitting just floats over the body. feels very light.
I really loved this top the minute i put it on. read the other reviews but it really worked for me. i am 5'3", 36dd, athletic build and the m fit perfectly with a nice roomy fit. top will be perfect for my upcoming trip to tahoe. plan to wear with light denim, dark denim, and black cropped denim bottoms. even looks great with a culottes or denim skirt. the weight is really nice and it washed nicely. i washed on delicate, and laid flat to dry. a little pressing and good as new. it has a nice boze
Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size
I really wanted the dark grey, but it has been sold out in my size for many months. i finally ended up with the navy. i think they are much cuter in person, the color nicer also. i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd. i got my usual size, and the fit was perfect. they stretch just enough. i would get the second pair in a heartbeat.
I ordered a petite small. i'm 5'3, 135 lbs and 34b and the length was perfect and the fit was great. like the previous reviews. love you can wear a bra with it.
I love this dress so much! i got petite and the length was perfect. it was so soft and so pretty. perfect for a wedding.
Soft, comfy, flattering, just a beautiful dress. it works for any occasion. i can't express how much i love it!
The romper is well made and just plain cute. i bought it the second i saw it and don't regret my impulse buy one bit. 135 5'5" and the small fit perfectly.
I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could, it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear), the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch, the fit is true to size, the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6"
I needed a dress to go to a reunion party(not hs) and this fit the bill perfectly. it fits perfectly and its short but not too short. it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its  perfect for out to dinner.
These cords are soft, comfy and my normal size 32 for tts. the length was fine for my 5'9 height. i really like the bronze color, it is almost a yellow.
I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately, but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly, it's flattering to my figure, the print is beautiful, the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium
True to size. length is perfect for 5'8"-5'9". soft fabric. not too low cut in the front, but not all covered up either. ruching is subtle and does not add bulk. skirt portion skims curves, neither clinging to them nor poufing out from them. strap design is perfect, covers bra while revealing a touch of skin. comfortable and effortless to wear, very very pretty.
This dress is so pretty. i loved the details on it. the material was ok. would have prefered a softer material so the bottom part of the dress would have been more flattering. unfortunately, it did not fit me right. i'm 5-2",34c, 28, 37 and the 4p fit ok. it hit just above my knees so the length was fine. what i did not like was that it was a little too loose around my waist making me look pregnant so unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm so sad cause this is a really pretty dress. you can dr
I feel like an indian princess in this dress! it isn't very forgiving, make sure you don't mind showing some skin - but there's some subtle rouching right at the spot where most of us wish we could hide at all times. great colors; boyfriend loves it.
Absolutely love this dress. i saw it online and didn't give it much thought and then saw it in the store and it was amazing. the photos really do not do it justice. the embroarding detail at the bottom is beyond beautiful in person. i agree that if you don't want skin showing you will need a black bra or black cami to over the delegate lace down the front and back of the dress. got this for fall/winter in fl and cannot wait to wear it, perfect holiday party dress!
This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer, ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous, free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5'1", 34f, size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami, as i'm not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4") and the open lines of lacy, small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through, and the skirt is lined. the re
This dress is great, and looks even prettier in person, the colors are more vibrant. the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect. most maxi's are too long on me, but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect. my only complaint is that it is very low cut, which i was unaware of standing up, but when i sat down at a dinner party, well, let's just say i gave everyone a show :(. recommend wearing a cami or something underneath.
I love this shirt. i'm 5' 4", 110lbs, just had 3rd baby so not into tight fighting clothes at the moment. love the loose yet flattering fit of this shirt. the sleeves are not too tight on me and i love the length.
This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant, beautiful pattern, the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me, so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color, it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!
I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. it hangs in a flattering way and the red has a nice soft hue. i couldn't believe what a great deal i got while on sale.
These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.  i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall, but these worked with the regular inseam.
The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!
I wore this dress to a party once and haven't been able to find an outfit that can top it!
I love these pants! comfortable, light and can be dressed up for work and down for the weekend. the color is a little more saturated in person, but can't really complain about that too much!
As a lazy one, i have to confess i barely leave any reviews even though i rely on the reviews from others to make my online order decision. yes! i owe a big "thank you" to anyone who wrote a helpful and honest reviews here :) and thank you!! now it is my time to pay back to the community. this pair of jeans are just perfect - perfect design, perfect fit and perfect material, soft, cozy and hip with a good spirit.. i don't want to take it off once i put on! i am 108 pounds and 5' 3" ordered size
Adorable and amazing quality. true to size. i ordered a 6 and fit perfect.
Very nice top. flattering and goes with everything. i bought the medium in the green but would have needed the large in the white as the white was a little see through and showed more of my flaws. i agree with the other reviewer in that this top has good button placement.
This shirt has such a fun twist on an otherwise basic jean shirt! i bought this shirt on a whim despite having a closet full of denim shirts... and i'm glad i did! the fabric is the same cloth
I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love, love ,love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy, but still fits very nicely. what a great buy, hope to see more of this style again.
Iordered hte petite after trying the rregualr size in the store, and i will have to wear heels with the pants... or get them hemmed... the color choices are all great, i wanted navy, but i have a pair of grey ones that look similar, so i deciced on the netural if my size is stil lavaialble in yellow at sale time, i will be grabbing those as well.  i went with 25, my typical size lately (115 lbs)
I love this shirt, it's easy to belt. i just wish it was tighter.
Finding pants off the rack that fit me is always a challenge - i'm petite (5' 1'), a bit curvy and short-waisted, so many of today's low-rise styles just do not work for me. however, these pants are a better cut and come pretty close to a perfect fit - comfortable and flattering, too. i've actually had pretty good luck with pilcro pants. i always have some gapping in the waist, but it's not much of an issue with these. more than likely whatever top i wear will hide that part. i was advised by th
I absolutely love these pants! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now. i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric. well, these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft. i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy. i love
These are the most comfortable, happening pants i have ever owned! they are extremely flattering and slimming at the waist. i am a size 4 and bought the 4, and they fit perfectly. they are a bit long, but after washing and drying on low, mine shrunk enough that i can wear them with flats or flip flops, and not just heels. my 2 teenage daughters have complimented me on them saying how "modern" they look. i bought them in navy and just ordered the grey yesterday. i might go into my local store and
I love these jeans, well,i have not worn them out yet so not sure if they will stretch, but just in terms of fit and cut, i really like them. i normally wear ch or ag in 25 or 26. i got these in 25 and they fit perfectly. i love the stretch, great color, not too thin, very comfie. i was worried about too much flare, but not a problem. they are very long, but i am only 5"2 and i will be hemming them about 8 inches .
I'm an avid retailer shopper. i bought this dress for my niece, her style tends to run  bohemian/gothic. the style, fabric and overall design/quality of this dress, is something i felt she would like (even though the color is not black). she loves it - perfect fit. she accessorized it with her usual biker/moto jacket,boots, etc. but it looks awesome on her!
This dress is absolutely beautiful. i was hesitant to purchase it due to the price, but i just couldn't resist. it's so flowy and comfortable. it's quite long on me; i'm 5'5 and have to wear heels so that it doesn't drag, but could easily be fixed with alerations. i wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments.
Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied.
I absolutely love these pants. i got the yellow and it is a beautiful, soft color. the fabric is soft and flowing. i am 5'1", 102 lb and the 0 petite fit perfectly. some stated they are too long even in petite but i disagree. the patch pockets are darling. don't hesitate to try these pants out!
I am powerless to resist hot air balloons and had to get these the moment they popped up! the pjs are charming and comfortable. the material feels very satiny. it's hard to tell, but there are small white dots in the midst of the champagne colored background. true to size.
These pants are exactly what i expected. true to size and color were perfect! they feel so good to wear and love the detail in the sewing. perfect office attire or night out for dinner. just add a fancier blouse. ta da :) would highly recommend them.
I will be living in these this summer! i couldn't find them in my local store, so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my grey pair from my online order. the fabric feels so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch and the cut is very complimentary to those of us with athletic thighs. i was so pleased that i bought a black pair and discovered they look adorable with my tall boots and a black boxy sweater. they've already become my "go to" pants. everyone should have a fun pair of
1. i'm 5'5" tall, 143 lbs, and 38-32-40 and my normal size 10s fit me perfectly.
Gorgeous dress. perfect for something special. paired with black heels. runs a touch large. i normally wear a small (5'6 and 140 pounds) but i'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it's very roomy. the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it's just so pretty i don't care! def a keeper.
The perfect jeans for daytime and bending down with the kids or dressing up later for night. i love that the cuff isn't sewn, so you can choose to roll them down too. with just the right amount of stretch, they are extremely flattering. they are definitely my new favorite pair this season!
These pants are so great. i am 5'10 and the talls are actually a hair too long. but no complaints! just wish they made every color available in tall. i had been waiting for new colors to get a second pair and was disappointed they are only offered in regular length. but overall these pants are super comfortable and great for work. as far as sizing goes, i wear a 29 in the pilcro cord leggings and wear a 12 in these.
Love all pilcro, this is no exception. very flattering. slim fit but not skin tight. comfy!
I am so glad i waited for this to go on sale! this shirt is incredibly soft, with great detail on the fading. i ordered a medium (5'10", 160 lbs) and it fits perfectly.
I had been looking for a chambray shirt, but am not a fan of the typical button-down style. this shirt is very versatile, but is far more interesting with the lace up neckline. i received multiple compliments the first time i wore it. the material is incredibly soft, but i haven't laundered it yet, so i am not sure how it will holdup.
These pants are flattering and comfortable, plus they are cute, cute, cute. i'm a little too conservative to wear them with a striped top, but with a solid black or ivory/off white top they are perfect. can be work appropriate with a blazer or twin set or "girlfriends'" lunch appropriate with a tee or turtleneck. highly recommend
I never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one. it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing, from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt: slip, floral pattern, pleats. i literally feel like a princess/ greek muse in this dress. can't recommend it enough. true to size; i'm 5'7" and 133 lb and got a size 4.
These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6" and about 130lbs and the 2 fit and hit just above the ankle.
I ordered the neutral in a 2p. i had to hem them. i 5' about 110lbs. i wore them to wore. they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen. but they didn't look like i slept in them. i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair. a bit disappointed. debating if they'll stay or get returned. i see the notes about stretching. overall a nice pant for the money.
I own this shirt in dark green, navy, and white. it is perfect. it drapes in such a flattering way, nice weight. it shows curves in all the right ways but does not fit too snug, emphasizing every flaw. and finally... the buttons are placed perfectly so that you don't have to choose between extremely conservative or way too provocative (bra showing). well done!
Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.
I ordered this in a size s, my usual size and it fits great. i love the color, style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of, ever so slightly, poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color, i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!
This is a great basic t that works with shorts, pants, or a skirt.
So glad i ordered this dress. it fits true to size and is extra soft. i was unsure about the color, but it looks nicer in person. the fabric is a mid weight that hangs nicely. this will go great with leggings or tights and wear into spring.
I've had my eye on this for awhile, glad it was still in stock.  really great deep wine color, soft.  more texture and detail than i had appreciated in the picture.  love.
You will love this cardigan. very well made with beautiful details. the sleeves have the same detail as the collar and the back. has darker flecks that will go well with dark pants or cords or jeans. you will love this cardi! wish it came in more springy colors. i only gave it a lower rating for quality because the first one i tried on had a sleeve that was much tighter than the other sleeve. the replacement was fine!!
This is a beautiful sweater! it is not too heavy and the variation in knit from front to back makes not the same old boring sweater. the color is gorgeous.
I just love this dress! the color, the quality, the design - all great! sizing can be tricky however. i sized down due to reading the other reviews, and i'm glad i did - it fits perfectly! this dress does not have a zipper on top, so if you have broad shoulders it might be a little harder to squeeze into.
I purchased this sweet little cami in all three colors (the black for some reason only available to order in store). the fabric is luxurious and smooth to the touch! i've purchased other silk shells by eloise and would say this one runs small. i'm 5'2" 125lbs 34c and and typically wear an xs at retailer. this tank was too tight in the chest and i sized up to a small which fixed the problem. i can't wait to make my jeans and bomber jackets for fall just a little more special with these babies!
I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the 25% off dresses promotion a few months ago. i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it, but hemmed and hawed at the original price. it was a splurge even at 25% off, but as soon as i put it on i was in love. this dress is so soft. i wore it to see some old friends, and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was! the material is thick enough to have a decen
This shirt is perfect for me. i have very small shoulders, but i am pear shaped. so the flare on the bottom is welcomed for my body type. i bought 2 colors. i have a similar shirt from retailer a few years ago that was multicolor which i wear all the time, so i am thankful they have repeated this design. also i did get this on sale which is a more realistic price for the quality of this shirt.
I ordered this winth some trepidation as the dress looked a bit baggy on the model. i don't typically buy this style of dress because many times, they are unflattering on me. i'm 5'6" and 130 lbs, in very good shape. the small was perfect for me. a size up would've resulted in a baggier look. the length is perfect, above my knee; not too short, but short enough so i don't look frumpy. the dress drapes beautifully, and i can wear it with tights and boots now, and capri tights and wedge sandals in
I'm: 34a, 125 lbs, 5'8" purchased: small  i was going back and forth between xs and s. i decided on small because it fit better in my arms, didn't feel as tight. the xs fit well in the torso area and didn't have as much fabric as the small. the small also had a longer shirt tail.   if you don't have as much mass in the arms, get the xs. if you have some muscle or extra mass in the arms, it's better to go with the small.
I bought this skirt a month or so ago and only wore it for the first time yesterday. i thought the design was fluid, summer appropriate, and easy like sunday morning. i enjoyed wearing it so much that i went on to the retailer site today to order it in another color. and lo and behold i saw all the reviews on the sizing/fit. i totally respect other reviewers, so i questioned why that had not been my experience when i wore it yesterday, so much so that i went and put it on again, sans issues.i am n
This skirt is beautiful...the color is definitely more a greeny-gold then a true yellow gold...nice quality fabric, has some stretch, big pockets with cute lining, buttons are adorable, perfect knee length, sits higher on the waist. because it's not lined and the pockets are big, the pocket line is visible on my thigh area, so i am going up a size just so i don't see that...if you have less curves, your regular size should be perfect. it has so much character, but it!!
This is a very classy sweater/jacket. it is a beautiful color. i had not even noticed it until it was on sale, and then read all the favorable reviews. it can be dressy or casual as seen in this photo! so glad i got it!
I absolutely love this gorgeous cardigan. i will wear it for years to come!!
I adore this dress, the perfect summer dress that you can dress up or down. the color is vibrant and the fabric flows and feels fantastic against your skin. i love that you can still wear a strapless bra with it, but with the adjustable shoulder ties you can have it go as low as you want for a more sexy look. the bottom hem is this super cute fringe, so fun and feminine. and while it is a loose fitting dress i did not feel like my figure was drowned out by the fullness of the fabric. this dress
One of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable. you can tie them as loose or tight as you like. like other reviewers mentioned, the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing! i am 5'5 105 lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp. i have never worn petites before, so i don't know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger, but i definitely have neede
Yes, this top runs large and it doesn't show your curves, but it's still really cute and fun to wear. i first purchased the beautiful sage color, and after getting compliments, i also ordered the navy version. these tops are easy to wear, have an interesting detail at the neck, and could be layered. cozy, comfortable, stylish. love mine!
This swimsuit is aaaahmazing. seafolly is an australian brand and their sizing is way off, luckily i already own a one piece by them so i knew what size to order. i am usually a 0 or a 2, chest size 34 d, and i ordered a 6 in this and it fits perfectly. taking it out of the package i wasn't sure if it would fit, but it did! the keyhole is pretty open, and the shape of the sides and high neck make some cleavage happen. i got it in black and it's really sohpisticated, but still sexy and cool. i ca
I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.
Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami
This top! it is so simple, but so great at the same time! it does run large, and i'm not a skinny girl... but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down. i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesn't take away from that. i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft, washed-jean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather. it's casual, but so comfy. it's great for loungin
Color, style, adjustability, easy fit, flattering!  yes on so many levels!  oh wait it's on sale!  fantastic, magnificent and pretty!  i bought medium and in 39-28-35
Fit is tts and comfortable. the color didn't suit mine but if the color works for you then grab it because it's a beauty
I have been searching for a comfortable pair of flared jeans to wear with tennis shoes or flats. i have tried several different brands and these are amazing! they are super soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. the coloring is excellent for the casual look i am going for. the pocket detailing is cute and helps to flatter your bottom. i am 5'2" so these were very long but nothing a good seamstress can't fix. i will note that cutting of that much of the bottom will reduce som
This top is just adorable. i'm usually between an xs and a small and i went with the small and it's a little more roomy. i wanted it to be long enough. the colors are beautiful and it's a must have.
Gorgeous linen blend tee. purchased in grey and white. classic timeless staples. fits baggy which i love. for reference i am 32a 5'1 105 lbs. love love love!
I loved this top . it is beautiful.
The picture doesn't do it justice. i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing. the fit is true to size. i am large chested but it fit comfortable...i did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest. still looks amazing. i feel very feminine in this blouse. good quality material.
So stunning, i had to have it for my spring wardrobe! fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom. the model weara it just as it fits on me. if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isn't stretchy.
Besides being my favorite color to wear, this dress oozes vintage glamour while not looking like a costume. the fabric is super silky and will need a professional steaming to get out any wrinkles. the fit is not what i'm used to, because it fits in a 1940s type of way, and when i took it to my tailor, she ensured me that it is the perfect fit. the bodice is a bit looser than contemporary pieces, but is perfect for a night out.
These jeans hug in all the right places. the high waist accentuates my body and makes my legs look a mile long! the jeans will need a trip to the tailor to be hemmed, pooling even with my highest heels.
Beautiful dress! perfect mid length dress for the colder months. i tried a size 2 regular first (my normal dress size) but it was a little baggy, so the 0 fit perfectly.
I absolutely love this dress. i feel it's the perfect year-round piece. looks super cute with boots or booties. even with a cute baggy sweater over it. i am usually a small or medium, depending on brand. i'm a small with this one. and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back, it just worked better that way. it is not see-thru, though is a light material. i live in fl so i can wear year round. but up north, with tights and boots, you can too. so worth the price!
I have been hunting for a pair of high rise flares that have significant width at the bottom and these are perfect. i love the vintage silhouette and how they make your legs look a mile long and i adore how they open wide enough to cover my shoes, not to mention being long enough for me to wear a 3.5" heel and still skim the ground. for reference, i'm 5'8 140lbs with super long legs and straight athletic build. i sized up to a 30 which is usually for me in ag jeans so for the brand, they run tts
Beautiful, unique, colors perfect for winter. i received so many compliments at two holiday parties. and on sale, this is a no-brainer
The picture online doesn't do this pretty dress justice. i'm curvy, and always searching for dresses that don't make me look like a sack of potatoes. its pin tucks at the bust give it a little shape, and the print is much more vibrant in person. will look great with tights and a black blazer for dinners out.
Received this dress yesterday, love it! my initial hesitation in ordering this dress, even though it is my fav color....was rather bright for sept.. but loved it and decided to order and wear it next spring. delighted to open the package and see that the dress is much darker than in the pics...more of a jade green. it is still a summer fabric/style, however the darker color will be perfect for the warmer fall days ahead. this dress is beautifully made, superior workmanship, and the fabric i
This dress is sure to become one of my favorites! i ordered it online and the colors are even prettier in person; very vivid! it is a little light for the climate where i live right now but, i'm sure that as soon as it gets a little warmer i will be wearing it often. i can't wait!
I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings, and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin, i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!
I love sanctuary clothing. this parka is on the lighter side, good for this mild east coast winter. it is water repellent. the length hits me on my upper thigh and the sleeves are long ( good for longer limbs). i received many compliments.
Very flattering, not too short, beautiful. i'm 5.6, 36d, usually wear m in dresses, wide hips. the 8 fit very nicely.
Finally a white top that is not see through! this tank is very form fitting and flattering, but does not hug too tight. i am neither large nor small breasted and love the way the v-neck fits on me. for reference, i am 5'2, 105#, 32c and i got the xxs.
Very pleasantly surprised by this top! it's looser, but in a flowy not baggy way. i ordered the m. the vee is just right on me, tasteful but just low enough. love the sleeve length ordered thinking another black tee , but it's going to be well used,and great for evenings.
Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.
I purchased this dress online after two reviews and i am so glad i did. this is a work of art and beauty and will be my go to dress for spring and summer weddings, special occasions and other events. i am so glad the arms are covered with lace and flowers. this is spectacular.
I'm either a medium or large in retailer tops. i was able to wear a medium in this top. the color is vibrant and the material is soft and light. it will be a great spring and summer top. can't wait to wear it.
This dress runs large so i sized down. when it arrived i looked at it and thought the fabric was ugly and boring for a dress. it sat there for about two weeks till i tried it on. i love it! it is so comfortable and is so cute how the pockets hang. all it need is some long necklaces or a scarf to complete the look. i get complements on it everytime i wear it. my only complaint is that it peels under the arms a little bit.
This dress is amazing ! the colors in person are so vibrant and yet organic somehow at the same time. perhaps this is because the fabric has a really nice depth and texture to it. i got this dress for a summer wedding and it's casual yet dressy at the same time.   re: fit - the best thing about this dress - is a fit ! it's so incredibly flattering on, it fits like a glove. it just hugs your figure in the most flattering way, especially if you have an hourglass figure. the fit is true to size -
I'm so happy to add this lovely and unusual dress to my fall wardrobe. i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on. i wear a two or four, depending on the designer, and the two fit me perfectly. another reviewer said it's special occasion only, but i like it so much, i'll wear it more often. with that said, it's a wonderful go-to dress for the holiday season.
This dress is so cute. i love that it has pockets. it looks great with sandels, and also ballet flats. it is airy, and run true to size. i wear a small, and it fit perfect. i even bought the other navy, and cream dress. you will wear this dress over, and over. just roll up the sleeves, and throw it on, and your ready. just love it!!!!
I purchased the green print which has so many patterns and colors which makes this dress have a very interesting look. i love that it has a drop waist because it is so flattering to most body types.the other thing i liked was that this dress came in petite sizes, perfect for me.
I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer. they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch, see, try on and order through the store (which is much appreciated). i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available. the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here.  i mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee
I love this top, wish they had it in more colors, i would buy more!
I purchased this with some hesitation, having read that some people thought it was unflattering. but i couldn't resist the sale price, and i love a low-maintenance work top and doesn't require ironing. this fits the bill perfectly. it's made of high quality fabric, there's a soft inner lining with a side zip closure, and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into (i got a small), but once on it fit perfectly, and is so flattering i can't imagine why other
Should've ordered a larger size. it runs a bit tight around the top and the zipper isn't that helpful.
I'm 5'6 and between 100-105lbs. buying clothes from retailer is always a stuggle because i have a petite frame but i don't fall into the petite height range. i usually order a petite size and just deal with the shorter length, which is hard when you're all limbs. i purchased a 0r and i'm in love with the fit! the top of the dress fits under my arms perfectly! the waist of the dress also hits nicely. usually the waist of regular sized dresses falls below my natural waistline due to my short
I love the ease of this dress. the style can be dressed up or down. the straps are inset a little which doesn't work for every body type. the thin material can get caught and snag easily but otherwise this dress is a simple chic addition to my closet. the length is just right, not too long like some other maxi dresses. the lining underneath ends at the perfect length as well. the top part is lined well so it can be worn with or without a bra. i am normally a 4 or 6 in dresses. the waistband hits
I usually don't even consider this style of shirt, but i was intrigued by its soft fabric and texture. honestly, i love this shirt! it is so flattering and a perfect staple for any closet! i can wait to wear it out and about!
I had my eye on this for a while, and my store finally got it in (in tmie for the 40% off sweaters). too bad hte petite size was already sold out by then, however good thing isthe xs stil lfit me in a nice way. i wil lnever know about petite, decided to jsut purchase as is (they don't have xxs either#. the fit is on hte looser comfortable side. the red color is rich, and the design is subtle, adn will nto fall apart, so it add some interest to an otherwise typical pullover. will look nice with j
This is a great dress for those days where you just want to throw something on but still look put together. it hangs so well and feels so comfortable yet it has a style that is a combination of bohemian and part sophisticated . the colors are muted but they work so well. i wear it with flat strap sandals and have also paired it with wedges. i receive tons of compliments and have to make sure my daughter doesn't try to borrow it. would highly recommend.
Love this layering piece! a little low cut for my personal comfort, but a tank underneath works great.
I originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews. although it did fit, i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms. i returned for a medium (my usual size) and it was perfect. it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics. i love love love that it is long-sleeved and has pockets!!!!! i went ahead and ordered the other print as well! i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments. highly recommend!
Love love love this dress.  fits like a glove. beautiful details. amazing quality. i'm so happy with this dress and know i'll have it for years. :)
This jacket is gorgeous! the design is visually very interesting. the fabric is light enough that i can wear it to work and keep it on all day.
Love this sweater! the abstract floral design adds an understated romantic touch, the red is a beautiful rich red, and the cotton is super soft and comfy. i've tried it on with pencil skirts and jeans, and it looks great with both. i'm considering buying it in the off white too, but it does have some cons. one is the waist band hits me where it does on the model and if you look closely you can see where the sweater poof out over the band a bit--it does that on me too, unless i turn the band up t
I am totally in love with this sweater!! it is lightweight, comfortable, and very versatile. throw on a pair of jeans and it is casual. throw on dark slacks or a skirt and it is dressy. the design does not become the focus of the sweater but rather takes it up a notch making it a fun piece to wear. the color is not a light red, but rather a rich cabernet wine color. this sweater is well on its way to becoming one of my all time favorites!!
I was very nervous to buy this top, but because it was on such an excellent sale i went for it- tops like this usually end in me showing a ridiculous amount of cleavage or not being able to zip (i am a 32ddd) it past my waist. i ordered a small based on the other reviews and it fits perfectly! the wrap top is perfect and shows off my curves without showing too much. the fabric is very unique and the whole top is lined with a nice nylon/cotton blend so it is very soft and comfortable to wear. def
I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that's what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it wouldn't really look right but omg, it's 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans, leggings, jeggings, whatever and it's just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt.
I bought this shirt to wear to work (i'm a teacher). this shirt is so amazing. i'm able to pair it with work pants to dress it up, and in denim to dress it down. the cut is incredible, with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist. the length is perfect, and it just seems to create the most perfect shape. the material is high quality, and i just love the fabric texture. it's very soft, and gives a tiny bit of stretch, but not much. i did size up in this shirt (i'm u
I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer. i was drawn to the color and the swing. first of all, this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight. i love the flow of the loose peplum. the straps are nicely placed, because they're wider and accentuate my arms (and cover my bra straps). i love the little v neck detail. it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over, but the top stays conservative when truly upright. i wore this shirt 3 days in a row last week, and
Comfortable, relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!
This top is comfortable and flattering. i really like the simplicity- a wearable basic summer top, with a cute twist, just enough to make it contemporary, but not overstated.
I fell in love with this dress online and went to try on in the store. i'm 5'6, 128 lbs with some boobs, usually a s or size 4. i tried on the s and xs, and ended up buying the xs - and i've never worn an xs in my life. it is long and loose, hanging right at my knees. the body is roomy, and i am thinking of having it taken in a couple of inches at the waist. there is pleating in the front that begins just below my natural waist and extends out to the hips, plus pockets (!!!). the sleeves are lon
This will be a favorite sweater this winter. it has a loose but flattering fit. i purchased the red (a deep rusty red), and it fits me exactly as it does the model pictured...slightly loose but flattering, mid hip, open neckline. you can't tell in the picture, but the neckline is rolled. i am 5'2", 140 lbs., just a bit fluffy. the small fits me perfectly. i think that you could size down from your regular size if you prefer a closer fit. the sleeves are at the top of my hands, just below the wri
I bought this dress in the green. it runs big - i usually take a s and had to return for xs - i am 5'5" and 125. it flows beautifully and can be dressed up with heels or worn completely casual with flip flops. worth every penny!!
This tank runs very true to size. i ordered my usual size 8, which fits like a glove. couldn't go any smaller. very pretty fabric which is lined above the peplum. i personally like the higher peplum, but it's a personal choice. great purchase!
This was a christmas gift to my sister. she liked it so much she wore it the day after opening it. very cute design, lovely deep red color. only thing to look out for is the potential of fabric to snag - looks like it may do so easily if wearing long jewelry. may run a bit large, but the medium for her well (slightly loose fitting garment). she is 5'7 and would probably wear a large in a typical shirt.
I absolutely adore this shirt!!! the pinkish rosey color is beautiful and ended up being better than i had imagined. i will say that the shirt is a bit more casual than i thought it was going to be, the way it hangs or something..not really sure. nonetheless, it is perfect. can be dressed up or down, which is the best quality to have in any piece of clothing! i can tell i'm going to get a lot of wear out of it.
Very versatile top! i feel like i could dress it up or down. fits very nice and the material is soft.
I feel fabulous in this plum and charcoal vest. i am 5/9" and the m'l is the perfect length and size. i was initially attracted by the external seams (and color) and was delighted with the silhouette and soft structure of the wool blend fabric. it is versatile and yet a kind of signature piece that i will wear with joy. .
This will be a great summer staple.  good fit and very comfortable.  may go back and buy another color
This dress is a vintage 20s drop hem style, not meant to be tight to form.  that said, the bottom is loose so may want to size down.  5'2, 145 lbs= s.  i bought the neutral- navy pattern and it is absolutely gorgeus!  hints of peach and beautiful lace detail.  i literally got compliments all day long- from friends and strangers.  i paired it with a dark denim jacket.  absolute must have for sale price.
This dress is very flattering. i am writing a review to share my experience regarding sizing. i am 5'7" and wear 34a.  i tried on a size 0 that was at the store as a return and there was about a 3 inch gap to get the side zip closed. although i  normally wear a size 2, i ordered size 4 because of my experience with the dress at the store.  the size 4 is slightly big across the bust but looks ok. i think the size 2 would've been too tight.
Love this sweater! great for work. very soft and comfortable. color is gorgeous!
I love tiny's aesthetic--sweet, feminine, yet always with a slightly sexy edge. this dress doesn't disappoint! during 90% of the year, i'm always cold. finding cute dresses with long-sleeves is almost as challenging as finding a unicorn. this dress is near casual perfection. i plan to wear it on breezy summer nights on a cruise to greece i have coming up. it would also be a perfect spring/fall dress before the seasons change or could be worn in winder with tights and a cardigan. see, near perfec
I've already worn this dress 4 times and i bought 3 weeks ago. easy to wear, comfortable and flattering. i love and wish it was available it more patterns.
I was really drawn to this burgundy color on this sweater, but wasn't all that impressed with the style. as soon i tried it on, wow it is very flattering. the color is gorgeous, i can see myself using it with jeans, pencil skirts, pants. for reference it does run large, i am usually a x large but i got a large and fits beautifully.
Love this dress! it's even prettier in person. i found the sizing a little bit on the large side, but i read that many others had the opposite problem, particularly in the bust where i'm small/average for my size. even though it's a little big on me, it looks and feels great.
This dress is beautiful in person. i am 5'1 and was afraid it would be too long but it was perfect. i only need 2 inch heel and it will be fine.  details on the flowers are really nice. one more plus it machine washable.
I got this coat to throw over slacks at work with the ac, and it's perfect. the picture online is less flattering than in person. found that the medium was too large in shoulders and arm length, small was right for 140lb, 5'8", typical size 6.
Love the fabric, so soft and comfortable. it gives a very flattering silhouette. love those pants.
This dress is gorgeous- it's one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is! i found it to fit tts. although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam, it fits perfectly. if you have a bigger chest (d+), i would foresee this dress being too snug. however, i am a c and it fits just right! i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops, but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo
I am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up. i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust, had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully. the band is a tad loose, but any tighter wouldn't have fit in the bust. this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering, especially for those of us with an athletic build.
I've received so many complements when i wear this tunic. it's so comfortable and fits great. the fabric is light and feels good against my skin. this is, by far, my most favorite purchase from retailer and i wear it all the time with my leggings. love, love, love this tunic/dress!!
I tried this top on at store and didn't want to buy at full price even though it made my heart skip a beat with how adorable it was. it is even cuter on. so when i saw it finally went on sale and i got an additional 20% off i immediately ordered!!!! it is flowy, comfortable and fun. wore it today layered with a black turtleneck and long black vest.
Tiny are experts at making busy bohemian shirtdresses that look casual but retain a feminine drape.  it skims over my trouble spots without adding bulk.  this is my fourth dress from this label and it does not disappoint.  for my frame and style i chose tts but those of slender & petite builds may want to size down.  for reference i am 5'3" 140# 36dd.
Love it- super cute. can wear it to work with blazer or out at night. i'm 5'3" and got a size small, a little shorter in the front but that seems to be style, fits great
This is the perfect dress! for summer, fall, winter or spring, it is flattering and looks cute with booties, flip flops, brogues or barefoot! runs a teeny bit large - i wear a small to medium and the small is perfect! i might just buy the other color it comes in!!!!
For me to buy a tank top it better be special and this is. flattering without being skintight, it camouflages that little back bacon you sometimes get from a bra. the v-neck is low and is the same in the back. great length, super soft and the best part is you can wear a bra! i haven't washed this yet, but based on other reviews i'll probably hand wash and air dry. the only issue is the tag flops out every now and then.
This top looks just as it does on the model and it fit just as they said it would. i needed a nice shirt to wear with jeans and camouflage my new-mommy tummy and this was perfect! it's really comfortable and fun, too!
I love everything about this top! the fabric, the color, the fit! great top for spring and summer!
Another reviewer said it best, "i love the way this dress makes me feel." i couldn't agree more. the lines are perfect and effortless.  with all the different reviews on size, i went into the store to try it on. i am usually always a s or m at retailer and a s fit perfectly. i think sizing down any more takes away from the casual look of the dress. i am 5' 5", 130, and have a small bust.
